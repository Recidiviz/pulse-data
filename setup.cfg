; Show mypy errors when imports that can't be statically resolved (e.g. because an external library does not ship mypy
; stub files). In general, we should aim to only use libraries with mypy types defined.
;
; If we must use a library that does not have types defined we should (in this order):
; 1) Search for a third-party package with mypy stubs for this library and include that package in the dev-packages
;     section of the Pipfile
; 2) Find a different library to use that does have mypy types defined
; 3) Define your own stub files for portions of the library we use
;     (https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubs.html#stub-files)
; 4) Exempt the library below (discouraged)
