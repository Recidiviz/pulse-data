 
This is kind of complicated.

Article that explains why:
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-the-most-common-name-in-america/

The datasets used for the article:
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/most-common-name

The following general files are supplied for scrapers:
- last_only: For scrapers that can search by last name only. Sourced from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/most-common-name/surnames.csv

- last_and_first: For regions which require full names to search. Sourced from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/most-common-name/adjusted-name-combinations-list.csv


There are better ways to put together the full names list, given the start that fivethirtyeight has made. This hasn't been attempted / no real effort has gone into the name lists, yet.
