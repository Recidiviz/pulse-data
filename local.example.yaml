# This is an example file for using environment variables in local development.
# To adapt to your project, rename to local.yaml and set the 'value' fields
# below to the correct configuration for your project. The warning below is
# for the 'local.yaml' copy, not this template.

# IMPORTANT: This file is in the project .gitignore. If you change the name to
#            anything other than local.yaml, update the gitignore file as well
#            to prevent accidental check-in to the git repo.
