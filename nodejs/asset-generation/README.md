# Asset generation

A Node.JS application for data-driven asset generation with server-side React.

## Development

### Prerequisites

Run `yarn` for package dependencies.

Running the server or tests locally requires the "Public Sans" font, which can be installed by opening the
[font file](./src/fonts/PublicSans-Medium.ttf) locally and clicking Install.

### Commands

See `package.json`, but some highlights:

- `yarn dev`: run the local dev server
- `yarn storybook`: inspect the available components in Storybook.
- `yarn test`: run tests! Includes visual snapshot tests of the generated images.
