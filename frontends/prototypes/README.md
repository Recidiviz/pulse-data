A Firebase web application for testing rapid prototypes.

Be sure you have [firebase-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools) installed before working on this application!

## Frontend

## Backend

Prototypes that need persistent data or other backend functions should use Firebase services. Source code for Firebase Cloud Functions may be found in `functions/`.
