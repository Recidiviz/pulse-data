# Running the app

To spin up the backend: from the root of the repo, run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.case-triage.yaml up`.

For the frontend, run `yarn` from this directory to install all dependencies, and then run `yarn run dev`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
