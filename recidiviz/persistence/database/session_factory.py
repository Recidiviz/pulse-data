        # drives, SSDs) that may be faster than jumping around to random pages of an index. This is especially likely
        # when running over small sets of data. Setting this option changes the heuristic to almost always prefer index
        # reads.
        #
        # Our postgres instances run on SSDs, so this should increase performance for us. This is also important
        # because sequential reads lock an entire table, whereas index reads only lock the particular predicate from a
        # query. See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/transaction-iso.html and
        # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42288808/why-does-postgresql-serializable-transaction-think-this-as-conflict.
