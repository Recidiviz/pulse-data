    Note about charge matching:

    Our matching scheme here is designed to reduce turnover with our charge,
    sentence, an bond entities (i.e. preferring to update entities rather than
    replacing old ones).

    If possible, we match ingested_charges to db_charges while considering
    the equality of their children (bonds/sentences). If we cannot match an
    ingested_charge while considering its children, we attempt to match it only
    based on the charge fields. If the ingested_charge still has no match,
    it will be marked dropped.

    Because we can match two charges whose children are not equal, we sort our
    ingested_charges, attempting to match those with more children before
    those with fewer or none.

    Examples:
        1. Two identical charges are ingested, one with a bond (A) and one
        without (B). The same charges were also scraped yesterday, and are in
        our DB as charge C (with a bond) and D (without a bond)

        Because A could match either C or D, we sort our ingested charges by the
        number of children, so that we always attempt to match A before B. This
        ensures A matches to C, and then B matches to D.

        If we attempted to match B before A, B could match to C, causing a new
        bond to be added to B. Then A would match to D, and its bond would be
        dropped. This turnover is not desired.

        2. We scrape one charge from the website (A), and this charge is exactly
        the same as a charge in our DB (B), except that the ingested charge A
        now has a bond. In this case we'll first try to match A considering
        the child bond, and when no matches are found, we'll match just
        considering the charge fields. At this point A matches to B,
        and B gets a new bond created in the DB.
