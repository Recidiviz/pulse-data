# By default Airflow searches for DAG definitions in all files under the top level DAG folder and attempts to parse any files containing the word "dag" or "airflow"
# all of our files containing DAG definitions should be in the top level folder therefore we can ignore all files under the recidiviz subdirectory 
recidiviz/*
