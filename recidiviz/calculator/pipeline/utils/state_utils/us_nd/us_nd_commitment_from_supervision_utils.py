) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[StateSupervisionPeriod]]:
    """Determines whether the incarceration_period started because of a commitment from
    supervision. If a commitment from supervision did occur, this finds the supervision
    period from which the person was committed.

    For US_ND, commitments from supervision occur in the following circumstances:
        - The person was admitted to a state prison due to some kind of REVOCATION
          admission type.
        - The person was admitted to a state prison due to a NEW_ADMISSION (not a period
          of TEMPORARY_CUSTODY in a county jail) and was previously in a PROBATION
          supervision period that terminated due to a REVOCATION.

    Note that the case above that refers specifically to PROBATION does not include
    PAROLE supervision periods because 1) we think that PAROLE followed by NEW ADMISSION
    is not actually reasonably interpretable as a parole revocation based on how
    probation and parole are administered on the ground, i.e. probation is administered
    differently and might habitually result in these particular data consistencies to
    be dealt with here, and 2) we donâ€™t have mass examples of this happening in the data
    for PAROLE like we do for PROBATION.

    Also note that in this PROBATION case, we also ensure that there was not an
    intermediate period of incarceration in a state prison between the PROBATION
    REVOCATION and this incarceration period under examination, to make sure we do not
    mistakenly re-classify what is truly a NEW_ADMISSION as a PROBATION_REVOCATION.

    Args:
        - incarceration_period: The StateIncarcerationPeriod being evaluated for an
          instance of commitment from supervision.
        - supervision_periods: A list of the person's StateSupervisionPeriods
          that may be relevant as a commitment.
        - incarceration_period_index: The index of StateIncarcerationPeriods for this
          person, to check if previous incarceration periods impact this commitment.
    Returns:
        A tuple in the format [bool, Optional[StateSupervisionPeriod]] representing
        whether or not a commitment from supervision occurred and, if so, the
        supervision period from which the commitment occurred if it can be identified.
        It is not possible for this function to return True, None.
