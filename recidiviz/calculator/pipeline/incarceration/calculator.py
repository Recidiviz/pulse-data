"""Calculates incarceration metrics from incarceration events.

This contains the core logic for calculating incarceration metrics on a person-by-person basis. It transforms
IncarcerationEvents into incarceration metrics, key-value pairs where the key represents all of the dimensions
represented in the data point, and the value represents an indicator of whether the person should contribute to that
metric.
