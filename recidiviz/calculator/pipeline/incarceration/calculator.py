"""Calculates incarceration metrics from incarceration events.

This contains the core logic for calculating incarceration metrics on a person-by-person basis. It transforms
IncarcerationEvents into incarceration metrics, key-value pairs where the key represents all of the dimensions
represented in the data point, and the value represents an indicator of whether the person should contribute to that
metric.

    metrics. Each metric represents one of many possible combinations of characteristics being tracked for that event.

    males, one to White males, one to all people, and more depending on other dimensions in the data.
