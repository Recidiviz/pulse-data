# every charge is ingested as 'CONVICTED'), can we rework this criterion to check a
# table of charges to find new convictions since the start of a sentence, rather than
# having to join sentences to sentences?
# TODO(#35465): Fix historical-accuracy issues in this criterion. Because the
# `CONVICTION_DATE` (which becomes the `date_imposed`) in OR doesn't always represent
# the date of actual conviction in conditional discharge or diversion cases, sentences
# for those offenses may appear to have become ineligible earlier than they actually
# did.
