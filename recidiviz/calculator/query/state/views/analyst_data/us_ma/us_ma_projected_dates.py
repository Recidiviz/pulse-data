A person (as identified by COMMIT_NO) can have multiple rows of EGT date for a given report

over the relevant period. However, within a given report, the total credit columns (TOTAL_STATE_CREDIT 
and TOTAL_COMPLETION_CREDIT) and projected date columns (RTS_DATE, ORIGINAL_MAX_RELEASE_DATE, 
and ADJUSTED_MAX_RELEASE_DATE) will all be the same in each row an individual has, so we 
can retrieve the credit totals and projected dates for a given report simply by using a 
SELECT DISTINCT over the relevant columns.
