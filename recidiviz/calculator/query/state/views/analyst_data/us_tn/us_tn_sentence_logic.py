    -- Sentencing data lives in 4 places: Sentence, Diversion, PriorRecord, and ISCSentence (out of state sentence) 
    -- The first three have similar structures, so I union them and then flag ineligible offenses
    -- ISC Sentence has a different structure and very different offense type strings since these sentences are from all over the country
    -- The general wrangling here is to :
    -- 1) Flag ineligible offenses across all 3 datasets
    -- 2) Flag active and inactive sentences (not applicable for PriorRecord)
    -- 3) Use 1) and 2) to compute current offenses, lifetime offenses, max expiration date, and most recent start date
    -- The offense type criteria is:
        -- Offense type not domestic abuse or sexual assault
        -- Offense type not DUI in past 5 years
        -- Offense type not crime against person that resulted in physical bodily harm
        -- Offense type not crime where victim was under 18. Note, I did not see any OffenseDescriptions referencing a victim aged 
        -- less than 18, but did see some for people under 13, so that's what I've included
