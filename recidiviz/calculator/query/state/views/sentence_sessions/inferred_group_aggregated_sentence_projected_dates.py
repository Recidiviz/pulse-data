"""
Creates a table where each row are the aggregated projected dates for all 
individual sentences in an inferred sentence group. 

Note that this is an aggregation of NormalizedStateSentenceLength values 
and does not include any NormalizedStateSentenceGroupLength data.

Related views are:
- inferred_sentence_group_aggregated_sentence_projected_dates
- sentence_inferred_group_projected_date_sessions
- inferred_group_aggregated_projected_dates_validation

Rows can have null projected dates if the inferred sentence group consists
of only SUSPENDED sentences at the given inferred_group_update_datetime.

Output fields for this view are:

    - sentence_inferred_group_id: 
        The ID for the inferred sentence group. This can be used to link back to the
        constituent sentences and state provided sentence groups.

    - inferred_group_update_datetime:
        This is the datetime where the values in this row begin to be valid.

    - parole_eligibility_date:
        The maximum parole eligibility date across the NormalizedStateSentenceLength
        entities affiliated with this inferred group.

    - projected_parole_release_date:
        The maximum projected parole release date across the NormalizedStateSentenceLength
        entities affiliated with this inferred group. This is when we expect the affiliated 
        person to be released from incarceration to parole.

    - projected_full_term_release_date_min:
        The maximum projected completion date (min) across the NormalizedStateSentenceLength
        entities affiliated with this inferred group. This is earliest time we expect all sentences 
        of the affiliated person to be completed and that person to be released to liberty.

    - projected_full_term_release_date_max
        The maximum projected completion date (max) across the NormalizedStateSentenceLength
        entities affiliated with this inferred group. This is latest time we expect all sentences 
        of the affiliated person to be completed and that person to be released to liberty.
