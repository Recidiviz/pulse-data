"""
Creates a table where each row are the aggregated projected dates for all 
individual sentences in an inferred sentence group. 

Note that this is an aggregation of NormalizedStateSentenceLength values 
and does not include any NormalizedStateSentenceGroupLength data.

Output fields for this view are:

    - sentence_inferred_group_id: 
        The ID for the inferred sentence group. This can be used to link back to the
        constituent sentences and state provided sentence groups.

    - start_date:
        This is the date where the values in this row begin to be valid.

    - end_date_exclusive:
        This is the date where the values in this row become no longer valid.

    - parole_eligibility_date:
        The maximum parole eligibility date across the NormalizedStateSentenceLength
        entities affiliated with this inferred group.

    - projected_parole_release_date:
        The maximum projected parole release date across the NormalizedStateSentenceLength
        entities affiliated with this inferred group. This is when we expect the affiliated 
        person to be released from incarceration to parole.

    - projected_full_term_release_date_min:
        The minimum projected completion date (min) across the NormalizedStateSentenceLength
        entities affiliated with this inferred group. This is earliest time we expect all sentences 
        of the affiliated person to be completed and that person to be released to liberty.

    - projected_full_term_release_date_max
        The maximum projected completion date (max) across the NormalizedStateSentenceLength
        entities affiliated with this inferred group. This is latest time we expect all sentences 
        of the affiliated person to be completed and that person to be released to liberty.

For periods of time when more than one sentence within an inferred group is being served, we take the max projected date
across sentences. However, if we have a situation where there are more than one sentence and one of those sentences has 
a null projected date and the other has a non-null date, we still want to keep the null date, as we are considering 
those to be intentional updates in normalized_state.state_sentence_group_length and 
normalized_state.state_sentence_length. Therefore, nulls are converted to our MAGIC_END_DATE value before calling max, 
and then reverted back to null afterward. If a state has no hydration of a column, we will also get a null value
