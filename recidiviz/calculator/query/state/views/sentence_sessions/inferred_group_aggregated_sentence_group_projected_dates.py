"""
Creates a table where each row are the aggregated projected dates for all 
state provided sentence groups in an inferred sentence group. 

Note that this is an aggregation of NormalizedStateSentenceGroupLength values 
and does not include any NormalizedStateSentenceLength data.

Related views are:
- inferred_group_aggregated_sentence_projected_dates
- sentence_inferred_group_projected_date_sessions
- inferred_group_aggregated_projected_dates_validation

Output fields for this view are:

    - sentence_inferred_group_id: 
        The ID for the inferred sentence group. This can be used to link back to the
        constituent sentences and state provided sentence groups.

    - inferred_group_update_datetime:
        This is the datetime where the values in this row begin to be valid.

    - parole_eligibility_date:
        The maximum parole eligibility date across the NormalizedStateSentenceGroupLength
        entities affiliated with this inferred group.

    - projected_parole_release_date:
        The maximum projected parole release date across the NormalizedStateSentenceGroupLength
        entities affiliated with this inferred group. This is when we expect the affiliated 
        person to be released from incarceration to parole.

    - projected_full_term_release_date_min:
        The maximum full term release date (min) across the NormalizedStateSentenceGroupLength
        entities affiliated with this inferred group. This is earliest time we expect all sentences 
        of the affiliated person to be completed and that person to be released to liberty.

    - projected_full_term_release_date_max
        The maximum full term release date (max) across the NormalizedStateSentenceGroupLength
        entities affiliated with this inferred group. This is latest time we expect all sentences 
        of the affiliated person to be completed and that person to be released to liberty.
