    ContactNoteComment is unique on OffenderID and ContactNoteDateTime while ContactNoteType is unique on OffenderID,
    ContactNoteDateTime, and ContactType. Which means POs enter one comment but a collection of ContactTypes at any 
    given time, and there can be multiple per day. 
    
    The trade-off between joining on Contact Date vs. ContactDateTime is the following:
    - For drug tests, we sometimes see a DRUL (drug test sent to lab) entered on Date X and Time Y, with the matching 
    comment describing what the person tested positive for, awaiting confirmation from the lab. Later on Date X Time Z, 
    there is a DRUP contact to confirm the positive test but not matching comment. For this reason, joining on Contact
    Date provides more complete information
    - A PO might enter completely unrelated contact notes on Date X at Time Y and Time Z - in this case, joining on date
    might just add some noise since we only care about the comment from Time Y but will get both
    
    For the CTEs below, we join on contact date and aggregate all relevant contact types and comments for a given date 
    which may be noisier than ideal but also hopefully more complete
