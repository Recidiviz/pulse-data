DATAFLOW_SESSIONS_VIEW_DESCRIPTION = """
## Overview

Dataflow sessions is the most finely grained sessionized view. This view is unique on `person_id` and `dataflow_session_id`. New sessions are defined by a gap in population data or a change in _any_ of the following fields:

1. `compartment_level_1`
2. `compartment_level_2`
3. `compartment_location`
4. `correctional_level`
5. `supervising_officer_external_id`
6. `case_type`

This table is the source of other sessions tables such as `compartment_sessions`, `location_sessions`, and `supervision_officer_sessions`. 

## Field Definitions

|	Field	|	Description	|
|	--------------------	|	--------------------	|
|	person_id	|	Unique person identifier	|
|	dataflow_session_id	|	Ordered session number per person	|
|	state_code	|	State	|
|	start_date	|	Start day of session	|
|	end_date	|	Last full day of session	|
|	session_attributes	|	This is an array that stores values for metric_source, compartment_level_1, compartment_level_2, correctional_level, supervising_officer_external_id, and compartment_location in cases where there is more than of these values on a given day. This field allows us to unnest to create overlapping sessions and look at cases where a person has more than one attribute for a given time period	|
|	last_day_of_data	|	The last day for which we have data, specific to a state. The is is calculated as the state min of the max day of which we have population data across supervision and population metrics within a state. For example, if in ID the max incarceration population date value is 2021-09-01 and the max supervision population date value is 2021-09-02, we would say that the last day of data for ID is 2021-09-01.	|

## Methodology

1. Union together the three population metrics
    1. There are three dataflow population metrics - `INCARCERATION_POPULATION`, `SUPERVISION_POPULATION`, and `SUPERVISION_OUT_OF_STATE_POPULATION`. Each of these has a value for each person and day for which they are counted towards that population. 

2. Deduplicate 
    1. There are cases in each of these individual dataflow metrics where we have the same person on the same day with different values for supervision types or specialized purpose for incarceration. If someone is present in both `PROBATION` and `PAROLE` on a given day, they are recategorized to `DUAL`. The unioned population data is then deduplicated to be unique on person and day. We prioritize the metrics in the following order: (1) `INCARCERATION_POPULATION`, (2) `SUPERVISION_POPULATION`, (3) `SUPERVISION_OUT_OF_STATE_POPULATION`. This means that if a person shows up in both incarceration and supervision population on the same day, we list that person as only being incarcerated.

3. Aggregate into sessions 
    1. Continuous dates within `metric_source`, `compartment_level_1`, `compartment_level_2`, `location`, `correctional_level`, `supervising_officer_external_id`, `case_type`, and `person_id`

    Union together incarceration and supervision population metrics (both in state and out of state). There are cases in 
    each of these individual dataflow metrics where we have the same person on the same day with different values for 
    supervision types or specialized purpose for incarceration. This deduplication is handled further down in the query. 

    Create a field that identifies the compartment_level_1 (incarceration vs supervision) and compartment_level_2.

    The field "metric_source" is pulled from dataflow metric as to distinguish the population metric data sources. This 
    is done because SUPERVISION can come from either SUPERVISION_POPULATION and SUPERVISION_OUT_OF_STATE_POPULATION.

    Compartment location is defined as facility for incarceration and judicial district for supervision periods.
