    /*
    This query combines together 2 dataflow metrics (INCARCERATION_ADMISSION, SUPERVISION_START)
    and then does some de-duplicating across person / days. Each of these metrics is de-duplicated individually.
    Look-up tables are used to prioritize start reasons when there is more than one 
    start for a given person on a given day. This is less of an issue with the SUPERVISION_REVOCATION and 
    the de-duplicating logic is just handled within the query. The 
    INCARCERATION_COMMITMENT_FROM_SUPERVISION metric is also brought in to gather 
    some additional details on incarceration admissions that qualify as commitments 
    from supervision.

    A person should in theory not be able to have a supervision start and an 
    incarceration admission on the same day. However, this does happen and is NOT deduped in 
    this view, but is instead handled by the join with sessions (join is done based on person_id, start_date, and 
    compartment_level_1).
