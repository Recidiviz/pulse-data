## Overview

This view is an aggregated view of sessions that represent a continuous stay within the 
system. A `LIBERTY` session triggers the start of a new system session. This view is 
unique on person and system session id.

As an example, say a person had the following compartment sessions:

1. `INCARCERATION - GENERAL`
2. `SUPERVISION - PAROLE`
3. `INCARCERATION - GENERAL`
4. `SUPERVISION - PAROLE`
5. `LIBERTY - LIBERTY_REPEAT_IN_SYSTEM`
6. `SUPERVISION - PROBATION`
7. `LIBERTY - LIBERTY_FIRST_TIME_IN_SYSTEM`

This person would have two system sessions - one that encompasses compartment sessions 
1 - 4 and one that encompasses compartment session 6. 

## Field Definitions

|	Field	|	Description	|
|	--------------------	|	--------------------	|
|	state_code	|	State code of the person	|
|	person_id	|	Unique person identifier	|
|	system_session_id	|	System session identifier. A new ID is triggered based on a LIBERTY compartment session	|
|	start_date	|	System session start date	|
|	end_date	|	System session end date	|
|	incarceration_days	|	Days of system session spent in incarceration	|
|	supervision_days	|	Days of system session spent under supervision	|
|	session_length_days	|	Total length of system session	|
|	session_id_start	|	Compartment session id associated with the start of the system session	|
|	session_id_end	|	Compartment session id associated with the end of the system session	|
