A table of incarceration sessions that end in release with session identifiers for a subsequent reincarceration 
sessions.

This query leverages the recidivism count dataflow metric to identify reincarcerations. This metric has a field
"days_at_liberty" that is used to identify the prior session from which the person was released.

The dataflow metric is used to identify release and re-incarceration sessions for those cases where someone was 
reincarcerated, and this is left joined to compartment_sessions so that we have a record for every release.
