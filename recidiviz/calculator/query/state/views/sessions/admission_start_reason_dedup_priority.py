This view defines a prioritized ranking for supervision start reasons and incarceration admission reasons. This view is
ultimately used to deduplicate incarceration admissions and supervision starts so that there is only one event per person
per day. Prioritization and deduplication is done within incarceration and within supervision meaning that a person
could in theory have both a supervision start and incarceration admission on the same day. Deduplication across incarceration
and supervision is handled based on a join condition to deduplicated population metrics
