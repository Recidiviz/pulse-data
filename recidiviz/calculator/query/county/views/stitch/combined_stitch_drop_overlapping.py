Combine {itp}, {state}, {scraper} into one unified view. When overlapping data
exists, we select {state} data first. We then select any {itp} data that exists
before {state} data. We then select and {scraper} data that exists after {state}
data. 

Note: Use we use valid_from to check cutoffs, instead of checking valid_from and
valid_to (eg: {itp}.valid_to < {state}.valid_from). This is because all data
points are plotted using valid_from.
