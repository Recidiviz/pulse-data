data that exists before {state} data. We then select any {scraper}
data that exists after {state} data and finally the {single_count}
data after that.

Note: we use valid_from to check cutoffs, instead of checking
valid_from and valid_to (eg: {itp}.valid_to < {state}.valid_from).
This is because all data points are plotted using valid_from.  """.format(
