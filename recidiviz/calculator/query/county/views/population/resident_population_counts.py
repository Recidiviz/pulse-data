"""
Creates a resident population count table from
Vera's Incarceration Trends dataset. For every
year-fips-race-gender combination, there will be a `resident_pop` column.
Additionally, a `total_resident_pop` column is created that sums the entire
resident population for each year-fips combination.

Combines 'OTHER' and 'EXTERNAL_UNKNOWN' Race into 'OTHER/UNKNOWN'.

Create fake 'ALL' enums for Race and Gender fields.

Gender: 'ALL' sums Male, Female, and Unknown for each race.

Similarly, Race: 'ALL' sums every race for each gender.

DO NOT sum along race or gender, or you will double-count by including 'ALL'.
