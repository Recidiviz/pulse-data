STATE: FL
POLICY: elderly release (SB 574)
VERSION: ?
DATA SOURCE: FL DOC reports
DATA QUALITY: reasonable
HIGHEST PRIORITY MISSING DATA: sentencing data beyond averages
ADDITIONAL NOTES:
Admissions info was only available in five year age increaments, so assumed to be even across increment (eg 55-59, 60-64, etc.)
Proportion of people incarcerated for each crime was based on data for all inmates 50+
Compartment duration for prison based on average sentences
