STATE: IL
POLICY: three strikes
VERSION: V1
DATA SOURCE: upload files from Illinois Prison Data (Monthly) folder (see Spark tracker/IL folder)
DATA QUALITY: reasonable
HIGHEST PRIORITY MISSING DATA: total population data for individuals sentenced under policy
REFERENCE_DATE: January 2011
TIME_STEP: 1 month
POLICY NOTES: Currently, any offender whose third Class 1 or 2 offense occurs after the age
of 18 automatically has their third Class 1 or 2 offense upgraded to a Class X sentence. The proposed
policy would limit this sentence enhancement to individuals where all three convictions are forcible felonies.
