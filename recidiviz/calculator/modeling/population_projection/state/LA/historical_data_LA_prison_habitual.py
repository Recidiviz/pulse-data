STATE: LA
POLICY: The proposed policy would reclassify nonviolent habitual offenders as regular offenders and sentence
them under regular sentencing guidelines. It would do the same for violent habitual offenders who have only
committed nonviolent felonies in the past.
VERSION: v1
DATA SOURCE: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SLNtsOcbV_qBF0eaQsDfUZNdzQSFeRyB?usp=sharing
DATA QUALITY: reasonable
HIGHEST PRIORITY MISSING DATA: previous conviction history of violent habitual offenders
REFERENCE_DATE: January 2013
TIME_STEP: 1 month
ADDITIONAL NOTES: AFP would like us to model two scenarios: the first is the original language of the bill
that reclassifies both nonviolent offenders and violent offenders with no prior violent felonies; the second
is a more conservative reform that only applies to nonviolent offenders. To model the first policy, run the
full simulation; to model the second, only run the simulation for the 'nonviolent' disaggregation category.
