    "# Prologue: Setting up your Environment to Run this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "For all you non-technical folks, here are some tips to get you started:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual environment\n",
    "One easy mistake to make is to try to run a notebook without your virtual environment properly setup. The kinds of errors you're likely to see are `ModuleNotFound` errors complaining that you're missing some dependency or possibly `command not found` when you try to start a notebook in your terminal. If you see one of these errors, the two things to try are:\n",
    "1. run `pipenv sync --dev` in your terminal to update your dependencies. If you get an error, you may have to run `./initial_pipenv_setup_mac.sh\n",
    "` instead.\n",
    "2. run `pipenv shell` in your terminal to enter your virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Google Cloud / BigQuery access\n",
    "The other common issue is to get a permissions error accessing BigQuery. If you can successfully run the first cell of the setup but the second one breaks with a BiqQuery related error, try making sure you've done this stuff:\n",
    "1. Work through just the \"installation\" section of [this page](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart)\n",
    "2. in your terminal, run `gcloud auth application-default login` and follow the prompts that it gives you then run `gcloud config set project recidiviz-staging`. Note: if terminal says `command not found` when you try those, it means you didn't do step 1 properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Last but not least\n",
    "If you're still having trouble, just dm Paco. Don't hesitate! He won't mind!"

    "# Welcome to Population Projection!!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will help you build a feel for what our population projection modeling can do for you. To use it, go down the notebook editing the user inputs (**Look for the #USER INPUTS header!**) in each cell to play with the results. To run a cell, select it and hit the \"Run\" button (or hit Shift+Enter on your keyboard). Each time you open this notebook, you should run the \"Setup\" section exactly once, then you may skip forward and run whatever cell/section you'd like, as long as you run the first cell in a section before the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "FYI, most of the cells will take 20-60s to run. You tell a cell is still running if it has a (*) next to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a preface, here are some high level Pros / Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "* Can be arbitrarily lightweight. At its most basic, this model can be run with two numbers: the average prison admissions and the average prison LOS. In the other extreme, it can also be run with DSA data to produce a pretty robust population projection. The key point is that in either case the work is mostly done before you start.\n",
    "* Dynamically captures inter-relatedness of different parts of the Justice System (e.g. modeling sentence reductions will cause an increase in revocations from having more people released earlier).\n",
    "* Captures order-of-magnitude \"back-of-the-napkin\" effects robustly and super, super efficiently (e.g. If we abolish mandatory minimums in our state, what will the ballpark population reduction be?)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "* Limit to the accuracy of policy simulation. As you'll discover below, the model uses a set of simple parameters to define the policy effects. Often, those parameters have to be guesstimated. The uncertainty associated with these parameters is what makes it difficult to get past a ballpark estimate.\n",
    "* Cannot capture some second order effects. For example, the question of how early release will affect the revocation rate (e.g. whether people will commit more crime if they're released early vs. serve a full sentence) is difficult to incorporate into a policy projection.\n",
