      Used to track address changes for next recommended home contacts dates.  The alternative 
      would have been to ingest address periods and then track changes in the case compliance pipeline
      in calc, but that was too big of a lift at this time and we plan to readdress
      this tech debt when we work on Texas Tasks.
