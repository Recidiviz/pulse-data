"""Functionality for delivery of email reports.

This module implements delivery of emails. The expectation is that the emails are in the appropriate Storage bucket
and conform to the following:

1) The bucket contains a folder whose name is the batch id
2) Inside the folder is a single html file for each recipient
3) Each file name is [email address].html
4) The contents of the file are ready to be sent with no further modification

    Delivers emails to the email address specified in the generated email filename.

    If a redirect_address is provided, emails are sent to the redirect_address and the original recipient's email
    address's name (without the domain) is appended to the name (i.e. dev+recipient_name@recidiviz.org).

        batch: The batch of emails we're sending for
        report_date: The date of the report (ex. 2021, 5, 31)

        email_allowlist: (optional) A subset list of email addresses that are to receive the email. If not provided,
        all recipients will be sent emails to.

    Returns:
        A MultiRequestResult containing successes and failures for the emails that were sent

    Raises:
        Raises errors related to external services like Google Storage but continues attempting to send subsequent
        emails if it receives an exception while attempting to send.  In that case the error is logged.
