Hi {{ officer_given_name }},


I’m Serena, a Product Manager at Recidiviz working on tools to help {{ l10n.parole_agents }} improve outcomes of your clients. We’ve been working with your individual-level data to make sure we capture {{ l10n.pbpp }} policies and practices accurately.

{% if overdue_discharges %}
As we look through the data, we found these clients may be overdue for discharge this week because their {{ l10n.expiration_date }} has passed.

{% for overdue_discharge in overdue_discharges %}
{{ overdue_discharge.full_name }} ({{ overdue_discharge.person_external_id }}), expiration date on {{ overdue_discharge.expiration_date }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if upcoming_discharges %}
Here are a few clients who have an expiration date in the next 60 days that you can check to make sure their requirements are complete:

{% for upcoming_discharge in upcoming_discharges %}
{{ upcoming_discharge.full_name }} ({{ upcoming_discharge.person_external_id }}), expiration date on {{ upcoming_discharge.expiration_date }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

We are in an early development phase and want to make sure we get the data right, so if any of the information I mentioned looks incorrect, or there’s a valid reason why these folks would still be on supervision past their max date, please reply to this email and let me know!

Thanks!
Serena
