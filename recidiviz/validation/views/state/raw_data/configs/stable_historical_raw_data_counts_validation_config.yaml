# This file tracks exclusions for each state's stable_historical_raw_data_counts
# validation. This file has two types of exclusions:
#   - PERMANENT
#     for this type of exclusion, never run a validation for this file. this is a good
#     exclusion type if you don't care if this file changes in size
#   - DATE_RANGE
#     for this type of exclusion, exclude this date range when building the validation.
#     this is a good exclusion type if a jump in file size that is above the threshold
#     is a false positive and the failure won't cycle out soon. the same file tag in the
#     same region can have multiple entries if you want to exclude two distinct datetime
#     ranges
PERMANENT:
  US_IX:
    - file_tag: RECIDIVIZ_REFERENCE_supervisor_roster
      exclusion_reason:
        Small reference file that is updated infrequently -- small changes in file size
        cauase large % changes
  US_TN:
    - file_tag: Chain
      exclusion_reason:
        Small reference file that is updated infrequently -- small changes in file size

  US_MO:
    - file_tag: LBAKRDTA_TAK237

      datetime_end_exclusive: "2023-08-30T00:00:00Z"
      exclusion_reason:
        We inconsistently import sub-sections of the file based on what is needed
        because the file itself is so big
