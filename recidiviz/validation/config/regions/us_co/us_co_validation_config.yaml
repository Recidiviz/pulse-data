# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_CO.

region_code: US_CO
exclusions:
  - validation_name: dataflow_metrics_supervising_officer_staff_id_all_null
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: There is no supervision data in CO so all supervising officer external id should be null.
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: state_incarceration_period_by_admission_date_stable_counts
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 1.00
    override_reason: Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: state_incarceration_period_by_release_date_stable_counts
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 1.00
    override_reason: Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_facility
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.03
    override_reason: Data from the old system is causing more errors, need to find more conversions.
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: session_new_admissions_with_no_sentence_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 60000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 10/26 is 47,807 rows #TODO(#16229)
  - validation_name: session_liberty_releases_with_no_sentence_completion_date
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 3000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 10/26 is 2,144 rows #TODO(#16240)
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_descriptions
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 200
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 4/5/23 is 82 rows (0.02%)
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_uniform_offense_labels
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 310
    override_reason:
      Current failing level as of 8/15/23 is 303, requiring a bump from the previous hard
      failure level (300) and probably further invetigation. #TODO(#23226)
  - validation_name: sessions_missing_closest_sentence_imposed_group
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 200000
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 4/20/23 is 157,462 rows (56%) #TODO(#20401)
  - validation_name: sessions_persons_in_incarceration_or_supervision
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 20
    override_reason: Have a gap in time for receiving data between 04-06 2023.
  - validation_name: sentences_missing_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 580
    override_reason:
      We don't have accurate sentence data from CO. Modest increase starting on 8/2/23 requires
      a bump from the previous level (550), and probably further invetigation. #TODO(#23226)
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 20
    override_reason: Needs investigation. Current failing level as of 8/15/23 is 14 periods. #TODO(#23226)
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_after_open_period
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 5
    override_reason: Needs investigation. Started failing on 6/16/23; current failing level as of 8/15/23 is 4 admissions. #TODO(#23226)
