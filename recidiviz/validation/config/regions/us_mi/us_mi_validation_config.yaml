# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_ME.

region_code: US_MI
dev_mode: False
exclusions:
  - validation_name: supervision_staff_wrong_role
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason:
      We're ingesting supervisor periods for all staff and not just supervision staff
      cause this is coming from their database and not a manually entered roster.  So
      the assumptions made for the supervision_staff_wrong_role validation don't apply.
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: client_record_archive_duplicate_person_ids
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.01
    override_reason:
      A case where the MI accidentally assigned 2 sets of ids to a single person, and
      then at one point realized and then combined the records in the raw data so we
      combined their records in ingest. But that means now that this person was
      associated with two distinct offender_ids and so they came up as duplicates in the
      client record. Since it seems like this person no longer appears twice in the more
      recent client records, that means this no longer has any impact on workflows.
      # TODO(#23568)
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_facility_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 1.0
    override_reason:
      Needs further investigation. There are some facilities in the external data that
      don't appear in our data. In some cases (like "GUI"), it's not an actual facility
      in the external data but a category of facilities. In other cases (like "JLS",
      "ZPF", "ZPM"), they're facilities that we don't consider as part of incarceration
      but further investigation is required to confirm that they are being excluded in
      our incarceration periods view. Lastly, there are also some mismatches for
      facilities that no longer exist ("IRM"). As a note, MI has cautioned that the
      counts they have in the external data are also not entirely consistent.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_state_by_date_justice_counts_comparison #TODO(#13513)
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .125
    override_reason: Needs investigation; fails for years 2010-2013. #TODO(#13514)
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .035
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 9/26 is .0302 #TODO(#13880)
  - validation_name: supervision_population_by_type_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .11
    override_reason:
      Some error is expected because MI has told us that their validation
      numbers for suprevision have some weirdness. Hopefully we'll be able to get more
      reliable validation data for supervision population when we receive OTIS data.
      Some investigation is required however for the case where validations are
      producing different results in staging vs production.  Current failing level as of
      2/10 is 9.74% in staging and 10.11% in production #TODO(#18578), TODO(#16338)
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: admission_pfi_pop_pfi_mismatch
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 1500
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 9/26 is 1418 rows #TODO(#13882)
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_after_open_period
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 50
    override_reason: Mostly fixed but needs investigation for remaining cases.
  - validation_name: incarceration_commitments_subset_of_admissions
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 4
    override_reason: Needs investigation. Current failing level as of 9/26 is 4 rows #TODO(#15586)
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 1000
    override_reason: Needs further investigation; there's a known issue with
      incarceration periods (#13336) that might be related? Current failing level as of
      9/26 is 145071 rows #TODO(#13518)
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 2500
    override_reason: Addressed known issue with overlapping offender bookings so
      remaining errors needs further investigation. #TODO(#15587)
