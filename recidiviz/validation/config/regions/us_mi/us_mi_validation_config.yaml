# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_ME.

region_code: US_MI
dev_mode: False
exclusions: []
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_facility_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 1.0
    override_reason: Needs further investigation.
      There are some facilities in the external data that don't appear in our data.
      In some cases (like "GUI"), it's not an actual facility in the external data but a category of facilities.
      In other cases (like "JLS", "ZPF", "ZPM"), they're facilities that we don't consider as part of incarceration
      but further investigation is required to confirm that they are being excluded in our incarceration periods view.
      Lastly, there are also some mismatches for facilities that no longer exist ("IRM").
      As a note, MI has cautioned that the counts they have in the external data are also not entirely consistent.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_state_by_date_justice_counts_comparison #TODO(#13513)
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .1209
    override_reason: Needs investigation; fails for years 2010-2013. #TODO(#13514)
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .035
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 9/26 is .0302 #TODO(#13880)
  - validation_name: supervision_population_by_type_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .05
    override_reason:
      Some error is expected because MI has told us that their validation numbers for suprevision have some weirdness.
      Some investigation is required however for the case where validations are producing different results in
      staging vs production.  Current failing level as of 10/28 is 4.0% in staging and 3.2% in production #TODO(#16338)

    override_reason: Needs further investigation.
      There's a known issue with overlapping supervision periods that arise when offender bookings overlap
      but there are a few other scenarios as well.  Currently expected number of failing rows is ~5000 #TODO(#15587)
