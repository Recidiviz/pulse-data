# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_ME.

region_code: US_MI
dev_mode: False
exclusions:
  - validation_name: sentence_comparison
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: TODO(#28865) Hydrate new sentencing entities
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: client_record_archive_duplicate_person_ids
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.01
    override_reason:
      A case where the MI accidentally assigned 2 sets of ids to a single person, and
      then at one point realized and then combined the records in the raw data so we
      combined their records in ingest. But that means now that this person was
      associated with two distinct offender_ids and so they came up as duplicates in the
      client record. Since it seems like this person no longer appears twice in the more
      recent client records, that means this no longer has any impact on workflows.
      # TODO(#23568)
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_facility_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 1.0
    override_reason:
      Needs further investigation. There are some facilities in the external data that
      don't appear in our data. In some cases (like "GUI"), it's not an actual facility
      in the external data but a category of facilities. In other cases (like "JLS",
      "ZPF", "ZPM"), they're facilities that we don't consider as part of incarceration
      but further investigation is required to confirm that they are being excluded in
      our incarceration periods view. Lastly, there are also some mismatches for
      facilities that no longer exist ("IRM"). As a note, MI has cautioned that the
      counts they have in the external data are also not entirely consistent.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .035
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 9/26 is .0302 #TODO(#13880)
  - validation_name: supervision_population_by_type_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .18
    override_reason:
      Some error is expected because MI has told us that their validation
      numbers for supervision have some weirdness. Hopefully we'll be able to get more
      reliable validation data for supervision population when we receive OTIS data (TODO(#18578)).
      There have been some changes in this error rate recently most likely due to all the ingest
      changes we've made for outliers, where IN_CUSTODY supervision periods are no longer counted
      in the supervision population because we now infer an IP during those periods.
  - validation_name: person_caseload_location_sessions_caseload
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .25
    soft_max_allowed_error_override: .25
    override_reason: These errors shouldn't happen, but will be addressed in #TODO(#28363)
  - validation_name: person_caseload_location_sessions_location
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .5
    soft_max_allowed_error_override: .5
    override_reason: These errors shouldn't happen, but will be addressed in #TODO(#28363)
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: admission_pfi_pop_pfi_mismatch
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 200000
    override_reason:
      We infer a ton of temporary custody periods in normalization, and so this produces
      a ton of overlapping periods and so it's not surprising that we have such a high
      failure rate for this validation.  When we have a chance, we should investigate whether
      this validaiton ever makes sense for MI given all the inference we do #TODO(#13882)
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_after_open_period
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 50
    override_reason: Mostly fixed but needs investigation for remaining cases.
  - validation_name: incarceration_commitments_subset_of_admissions
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 4
    override_reason: Needs investigation. Current failing level as of 9/26 is 4 rows #TODO(#15586)
  - validation_name: session_new_admissions_with_no_sentence_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 350000
    override_reason:
      Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 10/26 is 326,285
      rows #TODO(#16227)
  - validation_name: session_liberty_releases_with_no_sentence_completion_date
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 100000
    override_reason:
      Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 10/26 is 69,392
      rows #TODO(#16237)
  - validation_name: supervision_termination_reason_no_date
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 10
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 10/28 is 3 rows #TODO(#16337)
  - validation_name: sentences_missing_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 20
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 11/2 is 9 rows
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_descriptions
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 50
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 4/5/23 is 0 rows
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_uniform_offense_labels
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 150
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 5/13/24 is 105 rows
  - validation_name: sessions_missing_closest_sentence_imposed_group
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 85000
    override_reason:
      This is largely due to the TEMPORARY_CUSTODY periods we infer, but the remaining cases
      require further investigation. #TODO(#22303)
  - validation_name: current_supervision_staff_missing_district
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 7
    override_reason: Not required for web tool.  Ticket to investigate #TODO(#26496)
  - validation_name: invalid_release_reasons_for_temporary_custody
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 35
    override_reason:
      Needs investigation but seems to be due to single day periods.  Current failing level
      as of 4/12 is 20 rows TODO(#26444)
  - validation_name: current_impact_funnel_status_duplicate_external_ids
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 10000
    override_reason:
      This validation is failing due to the way task eligibility spans are structured for MI.
      Bumping threshold for now until it's determined whether this is an issue or not.  See #25100
