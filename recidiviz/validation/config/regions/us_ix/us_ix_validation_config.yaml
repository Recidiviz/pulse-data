    exclusion_reason:
      TODO(#27607) the new data from atlas didn't quite match up with the existing
      external validation data we had. rather than remove this validation, we are
      migrating it and marking it as broken with a todo.
  - validation_name: population_projection_monthly_population_external_comparison
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason:
      TODO(#16974), TODO(#15942) we haven't launched population projections
      against Atlas yet (due to an outstanding question about paid beds), so US_IX can't
      be incorporated into this validation yet.

      TODO(#23970) Error rate should not have increased from 1.96% to 2.02% on 9/8/23
      because the external data is not changing. Could have to do with recent IP work.
      Needs to be investigated. error rate at 2.00% as of 10/28/24, and has not changed in a year.
      Status of ticket is to revisit if error rate changes.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.06
    override_reason:
      We now infer incarceration periods for periods during which folks are in federal or other state custody, which Idaho does not
      in their external validation data, which leads our incarceration population to be greater
      than their numbers.

      the issue is from ingested early discharges that are attached to dummy sentences

      See comment here (https://github.com/Recidiviz/pulse-data/issues/32322#issuecomment-2286728820).
      The underlying view is going to be deprecated so it's not really important to fix this.
