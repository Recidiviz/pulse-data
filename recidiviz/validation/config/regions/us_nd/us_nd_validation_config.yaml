# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_ND.

region_code: US_ND
exclusions:
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason:
      ND ingest constructs one supervision period per supervision sentence - we expect supervision
      periods to overlap
  - validation_name: sentence_comparison
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: TODO(#28866) Hydrate new sentencing entities
  - validation_name: person_caseload_location_sessions_location
    exclusion_type: BROKEN
    exclusion_reason: This validation is currently broken. # TODO(#28365)
  - validation_name: person_caseload_location_sessions_caseload
    exclusion_type: BROKEN
    exclusion_reason: This validation is currently broken. # TODO(#28365)
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_facility_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.03
    override_reason:
      Given the very small size of some facilities in ND, this is actually a very strict threshold and we
      likely will not be able to do better. We're also already checking facility accuracy over the whole population with
      incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people validation.
  - validation_name: client_record_archive_duplicate_person_ids
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.0024
    override_reason:
      There was a period of time in September '22 where we exported multiple rows in the
      client_record for a handful of people who had multiple distinct officer_ids or
      expiration_dates. Because the impact/engagement metrics only look at distinct person/external
      ids, there is no known practical effect of having multiple entries for the same person with
      the same person and external id.
  - validation_name: state_supervision_violation_response_by_response_date_stable_counts
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .26
    override_reason: This is standard deviation for this validation.
  - validation_name: outlier_status_percent_change_exceeded
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.40
    override_reason:
      Given the very small size of the staff and population in ND, this is actually a
      relatively strict threshold.
  - validation_name: outliers_staff_count_percent_change_intramonth
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.03
    override_reason:
      Given the very small size of the staff and population in ND, this
      is actually a very strict threshold.
  - validation_name: client_and_resident_record_percent_change_in_eligibility_exceeded
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .95
    override_reason:
      Supervision uses SID and facilities use ELITE ids. Our resident record
      archive view queries person_id_to_external_id which only uses SID. We need to
      support EIDs as well, at least for residents. #TODO(#33349)
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 120
    override_reason: TODO(#31847)  - Needs investigation.
      Likely related to shifting IP external ids.
  - validation_name: invalid_admission_reason_and_pfi
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 10
    override_reason:
      TODO(#3723) - As of 12/07/2021 there are 4 REVOCATION admission to
      OOS (out of state) which maps to INTERNAL_UNKNOWN PFI. This should be fixed when
      we have a comprehensive fix for handling OOS in ND.
  - validation_name: admission_pfi_pop_pfi_mismatch
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 100
    override_reason: TODO(#10625) - Need to be handled in IP pre-processing.
  - validation_name: session_new_admissions_with_no_sentence_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 11000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 7/29/24 is 9,490 rows #TODO(#16231)
  - validation_name: session_liberty_releases_with_no_sentence_completion_date
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 300
    override_reason: Needs investigation. Current failing level as of 7/29/24 is 228 rows. #TODO(#16241)
  - validation_name: sentences_missing_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 30000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 7/29/24 is 26,086 rows #TODO(#16436)
  - validation_name: sentences_undefined_relationship
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 20
    override_reason: Needs investigation. Current failing level as of 7/29/24 is 13 rows #TODO(#19047)
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_descriptions
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 200
    override_reason:
      Small number of rows missing descriptions in ref table. Current failing level as of
      2/3/25 is 152 rows. #TODO(#31843)
  - validation_name: sessions_missing_closest_sentence_imposed_group
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 3000
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 7/29/24 is 2,259 rows (2%) #TODO(#20403)
  - validation_name: invalid_release_reasons_for_temporary_custody
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 25
    override_reason: TODO(#26250) - Needs investigation
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_uniform_offense_labels
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 100
    override_reason: |-
      Will slowly grow until we rerun the CJARS script, which is currently loosely owned
      by DSI.
  - validation_name: workflows_primary_users_not_in_state_staff
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 60
    override_reason: |-
      This validation will flag every incarceration-side user as an erroring row until
      we ingest email addresses from Elite. #TODO(#37707)
