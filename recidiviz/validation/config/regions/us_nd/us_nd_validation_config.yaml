# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_ND.

region_code: US_ND
exclusions:
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: ND ingest constructs one supervision period per supervision sentence - we expect supervision
      periods to overlap
max_allowed_error_overrides: []  # This region will use only the default max_allowed_error values
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    num_allowed_rows_override: 500
    override_reason: TODO(#3641) - These bad periods likely were created due to weirdnesses with how we merge periods
      in entity matching in ND.
