# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_ND.

region_code: US_ND
exclusions:
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: ND ingest constructs one supervision period per supervision sentence - we expect supervision
      periods to overlap
  - validation_name: active_in_population_after_death_date
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: TODO(#6928) The pre-processing for periods ending in death is incomplete.
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_facility_external_comparison
    max_allowed_error_override: 0.05
    override_reason: Given the very small size of some facilities in ND, this is actually a very strict threshold and we
      likely will not be able to do better. We're also already checking facility accuracy over the whole population with
      incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people validation.
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    num_allowed_rows_override: 550
    override_reason: TODO(#3641) - These bad periods likely were created due to weirdnesses with how we merge periods
      in entity matching in ND.
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_after_open_period
    num_allowed_rows_override: 250
    override_reason: TODO(#5803) - Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: incarceration_release_prior_to_admission
    num_allowed_rows_override: 10
    override_reason: TODO(#5803) - Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_nulls
    num_allowed_rows_override: 1500
    override_reason: TODO(#5803) - Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: supervision_termination_reason_no_date
    num_allowed_rows_override: 1
    override_reason: TODO(#5803) - Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: supervision_termination_prior_to_start
    num_allowed_rows_override: 300
    override_reason: TODO(#5803) - Needs investigation.
