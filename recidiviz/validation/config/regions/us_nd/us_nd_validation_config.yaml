# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_ND.

region_code: US_ND
exclusions:
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason:
      ND ingest constructs one supervision period per supervision sentence - we expect supervision
      periods to overlap
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_facility_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.05
    override_reason:
      Given the very small size of some facilities in ND, this is actually a very strict threshold and we
      likely will not be able to do better. We're also already checking facility accuracy over the whole population with
      incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people validation.
  - validation_name: client_record_archive_duplicate_person_ids
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.0024
    override_reason:
      There was a period of time in September '22 where we exported multiple rows in the
      client_record for a handful of people who had multiple distinct officer_ids or
      expiration_dates. Because the impact/engagement metrics only look at distinct person/external
      ids, there is no known practical effect of having multiple entries for the same person with
      the same person and external id.
  - validation_name: state_incarceration_period_by_admission_date_stable_counts
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .28
    override_reason: This is standard deviation for this validation.
  - validation_name: state_incarceration_period_by_release_date_stable_counts
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .28
    override_reason: This is standard deviation for this validation.
  - validation_name: state_supervision_violation_response_by_response_date_stable_counts
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .28
    override_reason: This is standard deviation for this validation.
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 200
    override_reason: TODO(#5803)  - Needs investigation.
      Likely related to shifting IP external ids.
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_after_open_period
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 20
    override_reason: TODO(#5803) - Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: invalid_admission_reason_and_pfi
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 10
    override_reason:
      TODO(#3723) - As of 12/07/2021 there are 4 REVOCATION admission to
      OOS (out of state) which maps to INTERNAL_UNKNOWN PFI. This should be fixed when
      we have a comprehensive fix for handling OOS in ND.
  - validation_name: supervision_termination_prior_to_start
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 315
    override_reason: TODO(#5803), TODO(#24635) - Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: admission_pfi_pop_pfi_mismatch
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 520
    override_reason: TODO(#10625) - Need to be handled in IP pre-processing.
  - validation_name: session_new_admissions_with_no_sentence_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 11000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 2/13/24 is 9,300 rows #TODO(#16231)
  - validation_name: session_liberty_releases_with_no_sentence_completion_date
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 300
    override_reason: Needs investigation. Current failing level as of 2/13/24 is 227 rows. #TODO(#16241)
  - validation_name: sentences_missing_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 30000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 2/13/24 is 24,073 rows #TODO(#16436)
  - validation_name: sentences_undefined_relationship
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 100
    override_reason: Needs investigation. Current failing level as of 2/13/24 is 13 rows #TODO(#19047)
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_descriptions
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 500
    override_reason:
      Small number of rows missing descriptions in ref table. Current failing level as of
      2/13/24 is 187 rows. #TODO(#24733)
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_uniform_offense_labels
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 7500
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 2/13/24 is 7325 rows. #TODO(#24773)
  - validation_name: sessions_missing_closest_sentence_imposed_group
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 3000
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 2/13/24 is 2,351 rows (2%) #TODO(#20403)
  - validation_name: invalid_release_reasons_for_temporary_custody
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 150
    override_reason: TODO(#26250) - Needs investigation
