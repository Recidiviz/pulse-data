max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.04
    override_reason: >-
      P2 we generally seem to be overcounting by a bit, so not so worried that
      we're missing people. TODO(#19918)
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_state_by_date_justice_counts_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.1
    override_reason: >-
      P1 Small-ish error, and we're overestimating the population, so not super
      concerned that we are missing people. But worth looking at soon, along
      with the other incarceration related issues. TODO(#19917)
  - validation_name: supervision_termination_person_level_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.65
    override_reason: >-
      P2 Making noise and not currently relevant to any of our prodcuts.
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_district
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 1.00
    override_reason: >-
      P2 I think this is may be a simple mapping error with what we consider
      districts internally and externally. More details here:

  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 24000
    override_reason: >-
      P1 Not relevant to any of our products currently as we mostly care about
      just having an accurate population count (which we can see from
      supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison we do), though
      concerning.
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods

    override_reason: >-
      P2 we currently use raw data for SCCP, so while relevant, it isn't used.
