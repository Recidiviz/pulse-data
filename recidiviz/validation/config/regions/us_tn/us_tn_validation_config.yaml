# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_TN.

region_code: US_TN
exclusions: []
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_district
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.01
    override_reason: TODO(#17260) Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_facility_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 1.0
    override_reason: TODO(#13057) Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.20
    override_reason: TODO(#13057) Needs investigation. This threshold was bumped from .15 to .20 on 11/16/23 due to outliers refactors that started including TEMPORARY_CUSTODY periods as part of population when they were not previously. This decision should be revisited at some point, but for now we bump threshold.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_facility
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 1.0
    override_reason: TODO(#13057) Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: client_record_archive_duplicate_person_ids
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.01
    override_reason: TODO(#15351) Needs investigation. There is one ID not accounted for over a span of 5 days in September 2022.
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: admission_pfi_pop_pfi_mismatch
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 20000
    override_reason: TODO(#12167) Needs investigation. Ingest view mishandling zero-day incarceration periods. 552 failing rows as of 11/3/2022. This number jumped with incarceration period refactor to include housing units. Current error at 1059 as of 4/13/23. With refactors needed for Outliers to correctly attribute temporary custody periods, this error increased significantly. However, from the perspective of downstream handling in sessions and for what is needed in products, this mismatch is not causing issues/may actually be the correct interpretation. Error is 16654 as of 11/29/23. Will revisit this upon refactors after outliers launch.
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_after_open_period
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 120
    override_reason: TODO(#13055) Needs investigation. Current failing level as of 9/12/23 is 94 rows.
  - validation_name: invalid_release_reasons_for_temporary_custody
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 20000
    override_reason: TODO(#12166) Needs investigation. Ingest mappings don't currently map to temp custody releases. Number of erroring rows went from 90 to 114 then to 18926 after refactors with TEMPORARY_CUSTODY for outliers work. Bumping the threshold on 11/29/23 since we do think the priortiization of these release reasons may not line up with the correct mappings according to the state, but should revisit this when we prioritize validation refactors based on Outliers feedback.
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 150
    override_reason: Edge cases in TN data where there are two OffenderMovements of Departures on the same day, causing two periods to be generated. Error is increasing over time and should be addressed in some way to better handle zero-day periods. Error is 47 as of 5/18/22. Error is 62 as of 3/17/23. Error is 105 as of 7/11/23.
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 75000
    override_reason: In TN, there can be concurrent periods for the same offender under different supervision types. We expect this number to by high and grow gradually, but will keep an eye on it for any abnormal spikes.
  - validation_name: supervision_termination_prior_to_start
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 300
    override_reason: TODO(#12165) Needs investigation. Ingest view is mishandling supervision events during a supervision period with overlap and duplicating periods by reversing their dates.
  - validation_name: session_new_admissions_with_no_sentence_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 400000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 10/26 is 325,825 rows #TODO(#16230)
  - validation_name: session_liberty_releases_with_no_sentence_completion_date
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 125000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 10/26 is 376,632 rows #TODO(#16234)
  - validation_name: sentences_missing_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 60
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 8/15/23 is 23 rows. Current failing level as of 9/12/23 is 39 rows.
  - validation_name: sentences_undefined_relationship
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 4000
    override_reason: Needs investigation. Current failing level as of 2/24/23 is 2,193 rows #TODO(#19047)
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_descriptions
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 100
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 4/5/23 is 3 rows (0.0002%)
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_uniform_offense_labels
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 4000
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 4/5/23 is 3,356 rows (0.3%), some ISC codes are not decoded
  - validation_name: sessions_missing_closest_sentence_imposed_group
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 195000
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 4/20/23 is 178,074 rows (12%) #TODO(#20405)
  - validation_name: current_supervision_staff_missing_district
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 29
    override_reason:
      From initial ingest of staff, there are 29 people who have a role subtype that indicates supervision
      officer, but their actual location is a not a supervision office. We confirmed with the supervisor staff rosters that
      these people are not located in any of the supervision districts, and therefore it is okay to bump this threshold for
      any known person in the Staff tables that is not an active supervision officer in a district.
