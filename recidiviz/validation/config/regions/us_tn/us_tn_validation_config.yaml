    override_reason: TODO(#13057) Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_facility
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 1.0
    override_reason: TODO(#13057) Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_state_by_date_justice_counts_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.25
    override_reason: TODO(#12167) Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: client_record_archive_duplicate_person_ids
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.01
    override_reason: TODO(#15351) Needs investigation. There is one ID not accounted for over a span of 5 days in September 2022.
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: admission_pfi_pop_pfi_mismatch
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 1500
    override_reason: TODO(#12167) Needs investigation. Ingest view mishandling zero-day incarceration periods. 552 failing rows as of 11/3/2022. This number jumped with incarceration period refactor to include segregation. Current error at 1059 as of 4/13/23.
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_after_open_period
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 80
    override_reason: TODO(#13055) Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: invalid_release_reasons_for_temporary_custody
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 90
    override_reason: TODO(#12166) Needs investigation. Ingest mappings don't account currently map to temp custody releases
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 100
    override_reason: Edge cases in TN data where there are two OffenderMovements of Departures on the same day, causing two periods to be generated. Error is increasing over time and should be addressed in some way to better handle zero-day periods. Error is 47 as of 5/18/22. Error is 62 as of 3/17/23.
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 75000
    override_reason: In TN, there can be concurrent periods for the same offender under different supervision types. We expect this number to by high and grow gradually, but will keep an eye on it for any abnormal spikes.
  - validation_name: supervision_termination_prior_to_start
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 300
    override_reason: TODO(#12165) Needs investigation. Ingest view is mishandling supervision events during a supervision period with overlap and duplicating periods by reversing their dates.
  - validation_name: sentence_end_dates_before_start_dates
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 30000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 10/21 is 15,059 rows #TODO(#16190)
  - validation_name: session_new_admissions_with_no_sentence_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 400000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 10/26 is 325,825 rows #TODO(#16230)

  - validation_name: sentences_undefined_relationship

  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_descriptions
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 100
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 4/5/23 is 3 rows (0.0002%)
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_uniform_offense_labels
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 4000
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 4/5/23 is 3,356 rows (0.3%), some ISC codes are not decoded
