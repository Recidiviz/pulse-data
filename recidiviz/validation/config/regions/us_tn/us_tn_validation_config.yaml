# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_TN.

region_code: US_TN
# TODO(#5582): Enable validations for US_TN.
dev_mode: True
exclusions: []
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: case_termination_by_type_comparison_discharges
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.2
    override_reason: TODO(#12170) Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_state_by_date_justice_counts_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.25
    override_reason: TODO(#12167) Needs investigation.
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: admission_pfi_pop_pfi_mismatch
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 400
    override_reason: TODO(#12167) Needs investigation. Ingest view mishandling zero-day incarceration periods
  - validation_name: invalid_release_reasons_for_temporary_custody
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 58
    override_reason: TODO(#12166) Needs investigation. Ingest mappings don't account currently map to temp custody releases
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 3
    override_reason: Edge cases in TN data where there are two OffenderMovements of Departures on the same day, causing two periods to be generated.
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 75000
    override_reason: In TN, there can be concurrent periods for the same offender under different supervision types. We expect this number to by high and grow gradually, but will keep an eye on it for any abnormal spikes.
  - validation_name: supervision_termination_prior_to_start
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 300
    override_reason: TODO(#12165) Needs investigation. Ingest view is mishandling supervision events during a supervision period with overlap and duplicating periods by reversing their dates.
  - validation_name: supervision_termination_reason_no_date
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 3
    override_reason: TODO(#12164)- Needs investigation. Appears to be edge cases in administration on the TN side.
