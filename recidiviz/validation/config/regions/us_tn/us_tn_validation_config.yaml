# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_TN.

region_code: US_TN
exclusions:
  - validation_name: sentence_comparison
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: TODO(#28869) Hydrate new sentencing entities
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_facility_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 1.0
    override_reason: TODO(#13057) Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.20
    override_reason: TODO(#13057) Needs investigation. This threshold was bumped from .15 to .20 on 11/16/23 due to outliers refactors that started including TEMPORARY_CUSTODY periods as part of population when they were not previously. This decision should be revisited at some point, but for now we bump threshold.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_facility
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.05
    override_reason: TODO(#13057) Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: client_record_archive_duplicate_person_ids
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.001
    override_reason: TODO(#15351) Needs investigation. There is one ID not accounted for over a span of 5 days in September 2022.
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: admission_pfi_pop_pfi_mismatch
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 30000
    override_reason: TODO(#12167) Needs investigation. Ingest view mishandling zero-day incarceration periods. 552 failing rows as of 11/3/2022. This number jumped with incarceration period refactor to include housing units. Current error at 1059 as of 4/13/23. With refactors needed for Outliers to correctly attribute temporary custody periods, this error increased significantly. However, from the perspective of downstream handling in sessions and for what is needed in products, this mismatch is not causing issues/may actually be the correct interpretation. Error is 16654 as of 11/29/23. Will revisit this upon refactors after outliers launch. After another adjustment to include IN CUSTODY SPs, this validation spiked even further to 244,546. For now we bump the threshold while Insights launch validations are ongoing and will revisit in future.
  - validation_name: invalid_release_reasons_for_temporary_custody
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 20000
    override_reason: TODO(#12166) Needs investigation. Ingest mappings don't currently map to temp custody releases. Number of erroring rows went from 90 to 114 then to 18926 after refactors with TEMPORARY_CUSTODY for outliers work. Bumping the threshold on 11/29/23 since we do think the priortiization of these release reasons may not line up with the correct mappings according to the state, but should revisit this when we prioritize validation refactors based on Outliers feedback.
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 80000
    override_reason: In TN, there can be concurrent periods for the same offender under different supervision types. We expect this number to by high and grow gradually, but will keep an eye on it for any abnormal spikes.
  - validation_name: session_new_admissions_with_no_sentence_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 400000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 10/26 is 325,825 rows #TODO(#16230)
  - validation_name: session_liberty_releases_with_no_sentence_completion_date
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 125000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 10/26 is 376,632 rows #TODO(#16234)
  - validation_name: sentences_missing_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 12
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 12/27/24 is 6 rows.
  - validation_name: sentences_undefined_relationship
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 4000
    override_reason: Needs investigation. Current failing level as of 2/24/23 is 2,193 rows #TODO(#19047)
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_descriptions
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 10
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 12/27/24 is 5 rows
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_uniform_offense_labels
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 650
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 12/27/24 is 517, some ISC codes are not decoded
  - validation_name: sessions_missing_closest_sentence_imposed_group
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 230000
    override_reason: Failing level as of 4/8/24 is 220029 rows. Current failing level as of 2/6/24 was 215,026 rows. Failing level as of 4/20/23 was 178,074 rows (12%). #TODO(#20405)
  - validation_name: current_supervision_staff_missing_district
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 29
    override_reason:
      From initial ingest of staff, there are 29 people who have a role subtype that indicates supervision
      officer, but their actual location is a not a supervision office. We confirmed with the supervisor staff rosters that
      these people are not located in any of the supervision districts, and therefore it is okay to bump this threshold for
      any known person in the Staff tables that is not an active supervision officer in a district.
  - validation_name: unidentified_supervision_officer_supervisors
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 1
    override_reason:
      Since we manually get the supervisior roster information from TN approx once a quarter, there will be
      situations where a supervisor no longer has active roles periods because the are no longer an active employee, but
      still show up as a supervisor in open supervisor periods for the officers they used to supervise. We bump this threshold
      here as a running list of the supervisors who have gone inactive and therefore we need to make sure to check in with
      TN staff the next time we ask them for manual rosters. There is currently 1 failing row as of 12/12/2023.
