# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_IA.

region_code: US_IA
exclusions:
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: In PA, we ingest SPs on the term level and not the person level, so someone serving concurrent sentences would have overlapping periods.
max_allowed_error_overrides: []
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: in_custody_sps_have_associated_ip
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 2000
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 1/27/25 is 1475 rows in staging.  To investigate when we flesh out incarceration periods more. TODO(#37755)
