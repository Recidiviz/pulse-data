# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_PA.

region_code: US_PA
exclusions:
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervision_level
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: PA has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervision level
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervising_officer
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: PA has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervising officers
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison
    max_allowed_error_override: 0.03
    override_reason: PA external validation data was generated from snapshots at the time the population for a given
      month was measured. Over time, data gets backfilled as new info about what happened that month comes in, so our
      numbers will get "worse" as time goes on and we get more accurate data about movements.
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_after_open_period
    num_allowed_rows_override: 150
    override_reason: TODO(#4187) - These bad periods are created as a result of id instability explained further in the
      task. The actual number of bad periods is 69 as of 10/1 but it will increase over time with new data refreshes
      so I made this number have some wiggle room.
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    num_allowed_rows_override: 12500
    override_reason: TODO(#4187) - These bad periods are created as a result of id instability explained further in the
      task. The actual number of bad periods is 69 as of 10/1 but it will increase over time with new data refreshes
      so I made this number have some wiggle room.
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    num_allowed_rows_override: 14000
    override_reason: TODO(#4616) - We should not have this many overlapping supervision periods in PA. We believe part
      of this issue is due to unexpected duplicated rows in dbo_Release/dbo_HistRelease. This will require more
      investigation and a fix to the SQL-preprocessing query.
