# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_PA.

region_code: US_PA
exclusions:
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervision_level
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: PA has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervision level
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervising_officer
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: PA has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervising officers
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison
    max_allowed_error_override: 0.03
    override_reason: PA external validation data was generated from snapshots at the time the population for a given
      month was measured. Over time, data gets backfilled as new info about what happened that month comes in, so our
      numbers will get "worse" as time goes on and we get more accurate data about movements.
  - validation_name: revocation_matrix_comparison_supervision_population
    max_allowed_error_override: 0.015
    override_reason: TODO(3951) - Needs investigation. Currently has one row where value is 0.0117.
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_after_open_period
    num_allowed_rows_override: 31
    override_reason: TODO(3950) - Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: incarceration_release_prior_to_admission
    num_allowed_rows_override: 883
    override_reason: TODO(3950) - Needs investigation.
