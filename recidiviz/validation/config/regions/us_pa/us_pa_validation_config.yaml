# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_PA.

region_code: US_PA
exclusions:
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervision_level
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: PA has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervision level
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervising_officer
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: PA has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervising officers

max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.04
    override_reason:
      PA external validation data was generated from snapshots at the time the population for a given
      month was measured. Over time, data gets backfilled as new info about what happened that month comes in, so our
      numbers will get "worse" as time goes on and we get more accurate data about movements.
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_district
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.05
    override_reason: TODO(#9738) - needs investigation.
  - validation_name: supervision_termination_person_level_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.05
    override_reason: We have a slightly higher error rate (~3%) than we
      usually allow for our person-level supervision terminations comparison. This is
      due to a methodology discrepancy between ourselves and US_PA regarding counting a
      termination if a person continues to be on supervision after the "termination"
      date. There are some instances where US_PA counts a person as having a supervision
      termination on a date where the person actually continues on supervision (for
      another type of supervision). We are not counting these as terminations, causing
      the ~3% error rate.

      There is a small amount of disagreement between the two data
      sources we pull data from to hydrate incarceration periods - CCIS tables and DOC
      tables. This value was 12 as of 3/5/2021 and we expect that it may slowly grow
      over time as new data is added. Current failing level as of 2/13/24 is 1,316 rows.

      board holds and multiple revocation admissions on the same day, we end up with
      more than one commitment from supervision admission with multiple different parole
      board hold periods (of different lengths) that preceed them, which can cause
      different dates to be used for identifying SPs associated with an admission.
