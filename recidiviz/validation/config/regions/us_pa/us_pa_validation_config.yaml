# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_PA.

region_code: US_PA
exclusions:
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervision_level
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: PA has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervision level
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervising_officer
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: PA has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervising officers
  # TODO(#7437): Adjust this once PO Monthly Report is fully launched.
  - validation_name: po_report_missing_fields
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: PA has not yet been launched for PO Monthly report, so we are excluding this currently. To be fixed in \#7437.

max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.04
    override_reason:
      PA external validation data was generated from snapshots at the time the population for a given
      month was measured. Over time, data gets backfilled as new info about what happened that month comes in, so our
      numbers will get "worse" as time goes on and we get more accurate data about movements.
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_district
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.05
    soft_max_allowed_error_override: 0.01
    override_reason: Here we make the threshold stricter than the default of 0.02. TODO(#9738) - needs investigation.
  - validation_name: supervision_termination_person_level_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.1
    override_reason: We have a slightly higher error rate (~3%) than we
      usually allow for our person-level supervision terminations comparison. This is
      due to a methodology discrepancy between ourselves and US_PA regarding counting a
      termination if a person continues to be on supervision after the "termination"
      date. There are some instances where US_PA counts a person as having a supervision
      termination on a date where the person actually continues on supervision (for
      another type of supervision). We are not counting these as terminations, causing
      the ~3% error rate.

num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_after_open_period
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 1200
    override_reason:
      There is a small amount of disagreement between the two data
      sources we pull data from to hydrate incarceration periods - CCIS tables and DOC
      tables. This value was 12 as of 3/5/2021 and we expect that it may slowly grow
      over time as new data is added. TODO(#9734) - need to investigate increase due to
      CCC ingest. Rerun on 02/15/2022 did not improve these. There are 866 as of 03/01/2022.
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 150000
    override_reason:
      There is a small amount of disagreement between the two data
      sources we pull data from to hydrate incarceration periods - CCIS tables and DOC
      tables. This value was 133 as of 3/5/2021 and we expect that it may slowly grow
      over time as new data is added. TODO(#9736) - need to investgate CCC ingest overlaps
  - validation_name: incarceration_release_prior_to_admission

    override_reason: TODO(#9735) - needs investigation

    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 1500
    override_reason:
      TODO(#6253) - Likely a rare edge case related to ordering movements
      in the PA supervision_period ingest view. Rerun on 02/15/2022 did not improve these.
      There were 645 of these as of 03/01/2022. There are 1100 as of 07/01/2022.
  - validation_name: supervision_period_dates_existence
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 2
    override_reason:
      There are currently two ingested supervision periods that have empty
      date fields, evidenced at the ingest view layer as well. This is likely due to a specific edge case where a
      person's last supervision period start edge is a PO transfer with no end date and the subsequent period matching joins the edges twice,
      causing a supervision type mismatch between start and ends (such as 04 and 04,04) and therefore 2 periods that should
      actually be one. This will also cause an error for the other half of the duplicated period in
      superivision_termination_reason_no_date. For now, we will set the threshold at 2 as of 8/17/2022 and add the task
      into the PA backlog list. TODO(#14683) Fix supervision periods ingest view to be corrected to account for this edge case in order to prevent it happening again
      in the future.
  - validation_name: supervision_termination_reason_no_date
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 2
    override_reason:
      See supervision_period_dates_existence description above for issue with open periods and duplication for
      superivision types. TODO(#14683) - Fix supervision periods ingest view to be corrected to account for this edge case
  - validation_name: admission_pfi_pop_pfi_mismatch
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 4500
    override_reason:
      TODO(#10625) - Need to be handled in IP pre-processing. Rerun on 02/15/2022 did not improve these.
      There are 4271 of these as of 03/01/2022.
  - validation_name: multiple_supervision_info_for_commitment_admission
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 5
    override_reason:
      TODO(#10614) - In the rare case where a person has multiple periods of parole
      board holds and multiple revocation admissions on the same day, we end up with
      more than one commitment from supervision admission with multiple different parole
      board hold periods (of different lengths) that preceed them, which can cause
      different dates to be used for identifying SPs associated with an admission.
