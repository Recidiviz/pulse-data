      1% hard threshold bump until we can get person-level validation 
      data for debugging. TODO(#30582)

      5% is the tightest threshold the state thought we could get to given the quality
      of the raw data available. More recent months are within that threshold, and older
      months have higher error rates.

      These failing rows are all from 1992 or earlier and all relate to periods that have
      been closed for many years. They are likely due to data entry errors. This validation
      is worth investigating if we have a more recent example or one related to an open 
      period, but these old examples are okay to ignore.
      1% soft threshold bump and larger hard threshold bump until we can get person-level 
      validation data for debugging. TODO(#30514)
