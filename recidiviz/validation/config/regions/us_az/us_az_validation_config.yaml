# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_AZ.
region_code: US_AZ
exclusions:
  - validation_name: session_new_admissions_with_no_sentence_date_imposed
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: AZ is being hydrated only with v2 sentences
  - validation_name: sessions_missing_closest_sentence_imposed_group
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: AZ is being hydrated only with v2 sentences
  - validation_name: session_liberty_releases_with_no_sentence_completion_date
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: AZ is being hydrated only with v2 sentences
  - validation_name: admission_pfi_pop_pfi_mismatch
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: |-
      Due to the way revocations are tracked in AZ, a high failure rate for this validation
      is expected. Sessions resolves these mismatches by logically collapsing zero-day periods,
      so this validation failing has no impact downstream.
  - validation_name: person_caseload_location_sessions_caseload
    exclusion_type: BROKEN
    exclusion_reason: Failing at 99%, will be addressed in #TODO(#33744)
  - validation_name: person_caseload_location_sessions_location
    exclusion_type: BROKEN
    exclusion_reason: Failing at 97%, will be addressed in #TODO(#33744)
  - validation_name: case_insights_rates_missing_charges
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: Sentencing assistance case insights are not configured/launched for this state

    override_reason: |-
      5% is the tightest threshold the state thought we could get to given the quality
      of the raw data available. More recent months are within that threshold, and older
      months have higher error rates.
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervision_level
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .11
    override_reason: Investigation needed. TODO(#32640)

    override_reason: |-
      There are rare cases where a person is incarcerated with two distinct DOC_IDs assigned
      at the same time. These people presumably are serving two concurrent sentences at the same
      time. Current failing level as of 12/10/25 is 175 rows.
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
