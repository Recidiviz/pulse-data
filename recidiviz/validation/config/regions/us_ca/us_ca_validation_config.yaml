region_code: US_CA
dev_mode: False
exclusions:
  - validation_name: dataflow_metrics_supervising_officer_staff_id_all_null
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: TODO(#22105) -- We haven't hydrated supervising officer yet in supervision periods
  - validation_name: session_new_admissions_with_no_sentence_date_imposed
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: TODO(#20922) -- We haven't hydrated sentences yet
  - validation_name: dataflow_metrics_admission_reason_all_internal_unknown
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: TODO(#22106) -- We haven't hydrated admission reason in supervision periods yet
  - validation_name: sessions_missing_closest_sentence_imposed_group
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: TODO(#20922) -- We haven't hydrated sentences yet
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: state_supervision_period_by_termination_date_stable_counts
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: .32
    override_reason: .32 falls within an expected range of variation for this measure
  - validation_name: state_supervision_period_by_start_date_stable_counts
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.27
    override_reason: .27 falls within an expected range of variation for this measure
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 50
    override_reason: Very few cases (as of 7/10/2023 there were ~12 cases) and looked like it was likely entity deletion
  - validation_name: current_impact_funnel_status_duplicate_external_ids
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 1000
    override_reason: As of 1/17/2024, there are 808 failing rows. To investigate (#26789).
  - validation_name: location_ids_to_names_unique_ids
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 20
    override_reason: Known issue with longer term solution in the works.  See ticket (#28105)
