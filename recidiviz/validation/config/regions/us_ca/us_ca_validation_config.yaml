      We block PA I's who no longer appear in state_staff, no longer have a caseload, or
      have a name change (in which case a new staff member with the new email is
      introduced). There seem to be about 10 typically on any given week. Filtering out
      weeks with lower than 15 blocks to reduce noise.
