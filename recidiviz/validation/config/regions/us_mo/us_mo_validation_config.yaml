# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_MO.

region_code: US_MO
exclusions:
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervision_level
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: MO has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervision level
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervising_officer
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: MO has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervising officers
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: state_supervision_period_by_start_date_stable_counts
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.26
    override_reason: Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: sentence_type_by_district_by_demographics_internal_consistency
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.2
    override_reason: TODO(#5074) - The age_bucket_breakdown_sum column does not match the others - investigate.
  - validation_name: most_recent_assessment_date_by_person_by_state_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.5
    override_reason: Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: most_recent_assessment_score_by_person_by_state_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 1.0
    override_reason: Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: client_and_resident_record_percent_change_in_eligibility_exceeded
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.40
    override_reason:
      Since we get data from MO once per week, the percent change for opportunities tends to aggregate
      over the data in a week and then spike once it's all processed on Mondays. We expect most opportunities to fluctuate
      between 20-30% when new data comes in, so we bump this threshold to 40% in order to capture when the percent change
      is significantly larger than that which likely indicates something unusual is happening and should be investigated.
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 100000
    override_reason:
      In MO we rely on a table where they build incarceration period
      spans for us; some older rows have issues with overlap. Rerun did not improve this number. Error at 411
      rows as of 04/12/2022. Current error at 526 on 9/27/2022. TODO(#2738) - This issue should be resolved when we rewrite MO incarceration periods
      query to derive periods directly from the status codes table. TODO(#15905) - Rework in incarceration periods increased error. View/normalization investigation needed to improve error of 7028 as of 10/5/2022. However, only 335 of these periods (as of 10/05/2022) are from after 2010. Error is ballooning over time to 51304 as of 12/7/2022.
      Inital investigations into this show entity deletion as the main culprit. Error improved after refresh. This error should also be helped by continual work in MO
      for raw data tables and rework in TODO(#15905). When this errors again and until we rework the view, it means that entity deletion issues have grown greatly and we should do another historical refresh.
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 45000
    override_reason:
      Older raw data from MO contains overlapping period information that we do not correct. TODO(#9848) - In addition,
      we do a lot of preprocessing for supervision periods that is not yet persisted, which corrects almost all supervision periods
      that do follow standard formats. Rerun decreased error significantly, bumping threshold down to 1500 to note if it greatly
      increases again. Current error was at 1121 rows as of 03/01/2022. Error began steadily increasing again and is now
      at 1699 as of 07/01/2022. 2041 as of 9/27/2022. 2514 as of 1/11/23. Error improved after refresh and is now 201. Error is currently 30467 as of 10/19/23, 35166 as of 11/29/23. TODO(#24843) - We should do a refresh of the view.
      When this errors again and until we rework the view, it means that entity deletion issues have grown greatly and we should do another historical refresh.
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_after_open_period
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 3000
    override_reason: TODO(#15905). Error is 2500 as of 1/5/2022. Error now at 899 as of 1/25/23. Refresh reduced error. When this errors again and until we rework the view, it means that entity deletion issues have grown greatly and we should do another historical refresh.
  - validation_name: admission_pfi_pop_pfi_mismatch
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 400
    override_reason: TODO(#10625) - Need to be handled in IP pre-processing. TODO(#15905) - Relatedly from rework, need to handle same day periods more explicitly. Error is 96 as of 12/7/2022. TODO(#17629) - Error is 239 as of 1/5/2022.
  - validation_name: incarceration_release_prior_to_admission
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 30
    override_reason: TODO(#15706) - Investigate and eventually account for these specific situations from old raw data. After incarceration periods rework to include facility information, there are now a small number of rows from very old data that have a release  happening prior to admission. This is likely due to the multiple date sources we combine in the view and how we handle those periods. Because it is all from data older than 2000, this number should not grow.
  - validation_name: session_new_admissions_with_no_sentence_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 250000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 10/26 is 195,120 rows #TODO(#16226)
  - validation_name: session_liberty_releases_with_no_sentence_completion_date
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 150000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 10/26 is 102,721 rows #TODO(#16239)
  - validation_name: sentences_missing_date_imposed
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 4000
    override_reason: Needs investigation.  Current failing level as of 11/2 is 2,868 rows #TODO(#16437)
  - validation_name: sessions_persons_in_incarceration_or_supervision
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 190000
    override_reason: Currently have different logic between sessions and incarceration/supervision period views to filter out certain types of periods. #TODO(#15790) - Investigate best fix for longterm parity betweeen sessions and periods
  - validation_name: incarceration_commitments_subset_of_admissions
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 1
    override_reason: There appears to be one very old data point that surfaced on 11/28/2022 which is causing a failure in this validation now. It's not clear why this suddenly popped up, but all data will be refreshed with a full historical and this may be a result of wonkiness before that is done. TODO(#15905) - check on this after full data refresh.
  - validation_name: sentences_undefined_relationship
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 6000
    override_reason: Needs investigation. Current failing level as of 2/24/23 is 4,153 rows #TODO(#19047)
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_descriptions
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 50
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 4/5/23 is 0 rows
  - validation_name: normalized_state_charge_missing_uniform_offense_labels
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 2000000
    override_reason: MO charges must be sanitized of PII. Current failing level as of 4/5/23 is 1,726,658 rows (98%) #TODO(#18436)
  - validation_name: sessions_missing_closest_sentence_imposed_group
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 75000
    override_reason: Current failing level as of 4/20/23 is 61,378 rows (5%). Error increased to 71,241 as of 11/29/23. #TODO(#20402)
