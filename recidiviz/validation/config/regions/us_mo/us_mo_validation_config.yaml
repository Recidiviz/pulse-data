# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_MO.

region_code: US_MO
exclusions:
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervision_level
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: MO has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervision level
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervising_officer
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: MO has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervising officers
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: sentence_type_by_district_by_demographics_internal_consistency
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.2
    override_reason: TODO(#5074) - The age_bucket_breakdown_sum column does not match the others - investigate.
  - validation_name: most_recent_assessment_date_by_person_by_state_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.5
    override_reason: Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: most_recent_assessment_score_by_person_by_state_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 1.0
    override_reason: Needs investigation.
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 350
    override_reason: In MO we rely on a table where they build incarceration period spans for us; some older rows have issues with overlap.
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 1800
    override_reason: Older raw data from MO contains overlapping period information that we do not correct. TODO(#9848) - In addition,
      we do a lot of preprocessing for supervision periods that is not yet persisted, which corrects almost all supervision periods
      that do follow standard formats.
  - validation_name: supervision_termination_prior_to_start
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 5
    override_reason: TODO(#5073) - Edge case related to ids shifting because we're filtering out investigative periods
      and not clearing out None end_date values in entity matching.
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_after_open_period
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 200
    override_reason: TODO(#5075) - We are generating a stable SQN number in the incarceration periods queries but not
      actually using it. Doing so will likely make these edge case periods go away.
