# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_MO.

region_code: US_MO
exclusions:
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervision_level
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: MO has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervision level
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervising_officer
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: MO has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervising officers
max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: sentence_type_by_district_by_demographics_internal_consistency
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.2
    override_reason: TODO(#5074) - The age_bucket_breakdown_sum column does not match the others - investigate.
  - validation_name: most_recent_assessment_date_by_person_by_state_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.5
    override_reason: Needs investigation.
  - validation_name: most_recent_assessment_score_by_person_by_state_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 1.0
    override_reason: Needs investigation.
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 500
    override_reason:
      In MO we rely on a table where they build incarceration period
      spans for us; some older rows have issues with overlap. Rerun did not improve this number. Current error at 411
      rows as of 04/12/2022. TODO(#2738) - This issue should be resolved when we rewrite MO incarceration periods
      query to derive periods directly from the status codes table.
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 1500
    override_reason:
      Older raw data from MO contains overlapping period information that we do not correct. TODO(#9848) - In addition,
      we do a lot of preprocessing for supervision periods that is not yet persisted, which corrects almost all supervision periods
      that do follow standard formats. Rerun decreased error significantly, bumping threshold down to 1500 to note if it greatly
      increases again. Current error at 1121 rows as of 03/01/2022.
  - validation_name: incarceration_admission_after_open_period
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 200
    override_reason:
      TODO(#5075) - We are generating a stable SQN number in the incarceration periods queries but not
      actually using it. Doing so will likely make these edge case periods go away.
  - validation_name: admission_pfi_pop_pfi_mismatch
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 20
    override_reason: TODO(#10625) - Need to be handled in IP pre-processing.
