# Configuration for which validations to run for region US_MO.

region_code: US_MO
exclusions:
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervision_level
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: MO has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervision level
  - validation_name: supervision_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_supervising_officer
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: MO has not provided us with person-level validation data for supervising officers
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_by_facility_internal_comparison
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason: The incarceration pipeline run for MO only calculates metrics for 2019-12, which is outside the scope of the COVID report
max_allowed_error_overrides: []  # This region will use only the default max_allowed_error values
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: overlapping_incarceration_periods
    num_allowed_rows_override: 174
    override_reason: In MO we rely on a table where they build incarceration period spans for us; some older rows have issues with overlap.
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    num_allowed_rows_override: 30000
    override_reason: TODO(#4043) - Before we launch SQL preprocessing in MO to production, we should make sure these
      overlapping periods no longer exist.
