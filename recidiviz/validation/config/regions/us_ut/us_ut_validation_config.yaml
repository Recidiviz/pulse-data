dev_mode: False
exclusions:

    exclusion_reason: UT is being hydrated only with v2 sentences

  - validation_name: case_insights_rates_missing_charges
    exclusion_type: DOES_NOT_APPLY
    exclusion_reason:
      Sentencing assistance case insights are not configured/launched for this
      state
  - validation_name: person_caseload_location_sessions_caseload
    exclusion_type: BROKEN
    exclusion_reason: Failing in most states, will be addressed in #TODO(#47004)

max_allowed_error_overrides:
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison_matching_people_facility
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.025
    override_reason: |-
      A very small bump to accomodate the failure rate being 0.21% above the default threshold.
  - validation_name: incarceration_population_person_level_external_comparison
    hard_max_allowed_error_override: 0.04
    override_reason: |-
      Small bump until #42363 is addressed.
num_allowed_rows_overrides:
  - validation_name: overlapping_supervision_periods
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 15000
    override_reason: To investigate (#37797)
  - validation_name: admission_pfi_pop_pfi_mismatch
    hard_num_allowed_rows_override: 2000
    override_reason: |-
      This is a small error that is expected because of the way revocations
      and shock incarcerations are tracked in the raw data. We can observe all of the 
      transitions and key details we need despite these 0-day periods having conflicting
      PFI values.
