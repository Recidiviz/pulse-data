ingest_info Field Documentation
===============================

Overview
--------

An ingest_info holds information about an individual that will be ingested into the system. This is the documentation of the available data fields, which defines the data that can be input into the system.

Value format notes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  All data fields are optional.

-  All data fields are stored as strings.

-  The provided strings will be converted to the appropriate data types during the ingest progress, with errors surfaced if a value is provided that cannot be appropriately converted.

-  Certain fields are stored as enumerated types: the values of these fields are taken from a pre-specified set of values. Many common ways of representing a value can be converted into the valid values listed below (e.g., ‘F’, ‘Fem’, and ‘Female’ will each result in a value of ‘Female’ for gender).

-  Values are case insensitive.

Person
------

The ingest_info object is just a container that holds a list of Person objects. Each Person holds details about the individual, as well as a list of Booking objects holding available data in the times a person has been booked into a jail.
