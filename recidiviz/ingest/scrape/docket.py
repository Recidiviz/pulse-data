"""Utilities for working with the ingest docket, such as enqueueing and leasing
docket items, and purging the docket queue.

The ingest docket is a pull-based queue of ingest tasks that are ready to be
performed. Each docket item is a high-level task for some region and scraping
type that some scraper must perform before the scraping process can be
considered complete. It typically contains a name, id, and/or other information
to search for in some criminal justice system we are scraping.

The docket is made up of multiple queues, one for each combination of region and
scrape type. Each item is placed on the appropriate queue so that it is consumed
and processed by the correct scraper. When a scraper wants more work, it will
lease a docket item: pulling it from the queue and marking it as leased for some
duration. When the work is complete, the scraper acks the item on the queue. If
it has not been acked by some specified time period, i.e. it expires, it is
returned to the queue to be attempted again.

Note that the docket is backed by Pub/Sub. Typically Pub/Sub delivers each
message once and in the order in which it was published. However, messages may
sometimes be delivered out of order or more than once (never less than once).

Each task can launch zero to many additional tasks within the push-based queue
that the scraper is running atop. A high-level lifecycle looks like this:

1. Scraping is launched for a region and scrape type, e.g. (US_NY, background)
2. One or more docket items are enqueued on the appropriate docket queue
3. A scraper worker for (US_NY, background) leases the next task from the
appropriate docket and begins to process it
4. In the lifecycle of that task: a search is made, with a response including
potentially zero to many search results. For each result, a new task is enqueued
on the us-ny-scraper push queue to be picked up by another scraper worker for
(US_NY, background).
5. Based on the implementation of the scraper, a scraper worker may attempt to
fully drain its push queue of work before returning to the docket, or may lease
another docket item on its own time.

Attributes:
    BACKGROUND_BATCH_SIZE: (int) the number of rows to load from a name list
        file into memory at a time, for individual enqueue into the docket,
        for background scrapes specifically
    SNAPSHOT_BATCH_SIZE: (int) the number of snapshots or records to query from
        the database into memory at a time, for individual enqueue into the
        docket, for snapshot scrapes specifically
    SNAPSHOT_DISTANCE_YEARS: (int) the max number of years into the past we will
        search for relevant snapshots whose data to scrape again
    FILENAME_PREFIX: (string) the directory in which to find name list files
