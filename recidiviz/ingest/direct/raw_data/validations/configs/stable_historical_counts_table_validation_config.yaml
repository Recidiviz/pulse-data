# This file is used to define config to be used by the stable_historical_counts_table_validation.
# This file contains the following default values:
#  - time_window_lookback_days
#    The number of days to look back when calculating the median row count for a file.
#  - percent_change_tolerance
#    The percent change tolerance to use when comparing the median row count of a file
# And the following values that can be configured on a per-file tag basis:
#   - tolerance_override
#     This value is used to override the default percent change tolerance. This may be useful
#     for small files where even small changes in file size can cause large percent changes.
#   - date_range_exclusions
#     All files with an update_datetime within an excluded date range will (1) have the stable historical counts validation skipped
#     and (2) have their row counts excluded when calculating the median row count for other files.
#     This might be useful if there is a jump in file size, you can exclude older entries that have lower raw row counts.
#     If you import a file that has an update datetime within an excluded range, the validation will be skipped,
#     and the raw row count of that imported will be excluded from future median calculations.
#     This might be useful if you need to import a file that has an anomalously high or low row count but is valid.
#     The same file tag in the same region can have multiple entries if you want to exclude multiple distinct datetime ranges.
