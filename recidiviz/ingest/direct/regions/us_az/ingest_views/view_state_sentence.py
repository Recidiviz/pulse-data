Ingest view for StateSentence entities.

Sentencing data exists at three levels in AZ:
    - "offenses" are sentence and charge level concepts and their data maps to StateSentence entities
    - "commitments" are sentences and charges that share an imposition. While multiple sentences or
      charges may relate to a single commitment, data is still at the StateSentence/StateCharge level.
    - "episodes" are stints a person can have with the system and is comprised of offenses and commitments
      For example the AZ_DOC_SC_EPISODE file contains projected dates for 
      "all active offenses in all active commitments in this episode"

It follow that a StatePerson relates to StateSentenceGroup entities (episodes), and those
groups are related to StateSentence entities (made up of offenses imposed together in commitments)
that related to StateCharge entities (created from commitment data).


TODO(#29562) We default to STATE_PRISON sentences, but there may be some PROBATION sentences to hydrate.
