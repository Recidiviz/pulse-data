file_description: |-
  A Home Plan is a required component of release planning at AZ facilities. Home plans
  are drafted by case managers in prisons (COIIIs) while a person is still incarcerated; 
  they contain information about where the person will live after their release, and 
  other general release-planning details. The plan is sent to the community supervision 
  office where the person will be supervised upon their release, and must be approved 
  before the person can be released. 

  This is the master table for Home Plans, and can be used to connect a particular home plan
  to an individual using the DOC_ID field. There may be many rows in this table pertaining
  to the same person. The details of the plan itself and whether or not it was approved 
  are stored in AZ_DOC_HOME_PLAN_DETAIL and AZ_DOC_HOME_PLAN_APPROVAL, respectively.
