file_tag: RECIDIVIZ_REFERENCE_staff_id_override
file_description: |-
  A reference file maintained by Recidiviz based on feedback from Arizona about users
  we are conflating as a result of grouping USERID values by full name. The data in this
  sheet will allow us to differentiate between users with the same full name. Each user
  that shares a full name with another user will appear in this sheet with a distinct OVERRIDE_ID. 
  In the state_staff view, we can then group by full name and OVERRIDE_ID to differentiate
  between those two individuals. Each individual listed in this sheet should have exactly one
  OVERRIDE_ID value so that all of their USERIDs can be properly aggregated.

  For example, if we see these rows in the PERSON table:
  | FIRST_NAME | SURNAME | PERSON_ID |
  |-|-|-|
  |John|Doe|1|
  |John|Doe|2|
  |John|Doe|3|

  We would assume that there is exactly one John Doe, and they have been assigned each of
  the PERSON_IDs 1, 2, and 3 at some point. If we then get feedback from AZ that there
  are actually two employees named John Doe, we would clarify which IDs belong to which
  John Doe, and input the following into this reference data: 

  | FIRST_NAME | SURNAME | PERSON_ID | OVERRIDE_ID |
  |-|-|-|-|
  |John|Doe|1|1|
  |John|Doe|2|2|
  |John|Doe|3|1|

  This would allow us to differentiate between the two John Does: One who has had PERSON_IDs
  1 and 3, and one who has had PERSON_ID 2.

      Recidiviz-generated reference ID that will be used to group IDs that all belong to 
      the same user. If a user appears multiple times in this sheet with multiple IDs, 
      they will have the same FIRST_NAME, SURNAME, and OVERRIDE_ID.
