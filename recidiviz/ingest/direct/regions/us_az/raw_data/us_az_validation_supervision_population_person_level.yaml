file_description: |-
  This is an external validation dataset that lists each person on active supervision 
  on a given date, their identifying information, location, supervising officer, and supervision
  level. It is sourced from active supervision population reports run for each office
  individually in ACIS. This process currently must be run by a member of the ADCRR team. 
  The reports are then consolidated in Google Sheets and stored in go/arizona -> Validation Data
  before being uploaded as raw data.
