file_description: |-
  A validation view containing one record for all incarcerated and supervised
  persons in Idaho. The view is executed once daily and provides the current
  status of each person as of that moment.

  This is from the pre-Atlas data system. We hope to eventually replace this with data
  from Atlas once that is provided.
