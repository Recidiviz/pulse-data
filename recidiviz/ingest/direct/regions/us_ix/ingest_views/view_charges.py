    -- NOTES ABOUT THIS VIEW:
    -- Considering each offense sentence record as a charge record since: 
    --   - multiple offenses can attach with one sentence order
    --   - multiple orders can be attached to one charge
    --   - a single offense can be attached to a single offense sentence record
    -- All offense type records are "Conversions" records
    -- OffenseClassId always null so not using that for subclassification
    -- offense type has both a OffenseTypeDesc and a ShortDescription field that both contain the same description so 
       -- arbitrarily using OffenseTypeDesc
    -- Charge status is always 531 (Active) or 535 (Satisfied) so I don't think we can use it for charge status, and current
       -- ID mapping uses 'present without info' #TODO(#17184): Revisit for scl_Charge.ChargeOutcomeTypeId if want more granular status
