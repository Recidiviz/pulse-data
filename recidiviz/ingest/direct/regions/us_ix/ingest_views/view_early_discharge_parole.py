"""Ingest view query for US_IX parole early discharges"""

# In US_IX, there's a two part process for parole early discharge requests.
# First there's the "Review" step where the parole board decides whether to allow a hearing for the case.
# If the parole board grants the hearing request, then the second step is the actual "Hearing" where early discharge is decided.
#
# In Atlas, info about parole early discharge is stored in the parole board tables, where
# we have information on each parole board case (prb_PBCase), each parole board meeting (bop_BOPHearing) which is either "Review" or "Hearing",
# and each parole board meeting vote decision (bop_BOPVoteResult).  A single parole board case can
# have multiple meetings, and each meeting can have multiple vote decisions.  In addition, a single petition
# for early discharge from parole seems to be able to span multiple parole board cases.  For example, the "Review"
# step is often one parole board case, and if that is granted, then another parole board case is recorded for the "Hearing" step.
# Furthermore, the "Review" and "Hearing" steps can also have multiple vote decisions when the parole board decides to delay their decision
# (so you'll see a first vote decision of "Continue" and then a second vote decision of either "Grant" or "Deny").
# For our purposes, we're going to count the "Review" step and the "Hearing" step together as a single early discharge request.
# So the possible trajectories of a single early discharge request could be any of the following:
#  - Review -> Deny
#  - Review -> Grant, Hearing -> Deny
#  - Review -> Grant, Hearing -> Grant
#  - Review -> Continue, Review -> Deny
#  - Review -> Continue, Review -> Grant, Hearing -> Grant
#  - etc.
# There are some other additional vote values but are infrequent and not as relevant for our purposes
