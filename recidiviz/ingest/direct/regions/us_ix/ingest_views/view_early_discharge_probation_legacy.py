-- In a small handful of cases, a single early discharge record can be attached to multiple decisions where each decision is under a different sentence
-- In US_ID, we ingested early discharge on the sentence level and so it didn't matter when there were multiple decisions per early discharge record.
-- For US_IX, we won't be ingesting early discharge on the sentence level since early discharge information is on the individual level in Atlas.  Furthermore, there's no way to link sentences in US_ID to sentences in US_IX.
-- Therefore, we'll ingest each early discharge record as an early dicharge entity, so we'll concatenate the decisions here and then deal with conflicting decisions in the mapping.
