# For Idaho, we're going to pull staff information from both CIS (their legacy system) and ATLAS (their new system)
# In CIS, the ID variable for employees is empl_cd, and in ATLAS, the ID variable for employees is EmployeeId
# The key we're using to link staff across systems is StaffId, which in CIS is stored in a field called empl_sdesc,
# and in Atlas is stored either in a field called StaffId or used as part of the email.
# Since there might be multiple records attached to each StaffId within each source, we're going to use EmployeeId, empl_cd,
# and StaffId all as valid id types and allow multiple values for each type.  For name info, we're going to only pull from
# the newest record found for that StaffId.
