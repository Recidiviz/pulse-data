-- The hsn_FacilityLevel table is hierarchical in nature with three levels of parent/child references.
-- We define tiers as follows:
--   Tier 1: facility levels with no parents, in other words top-level facility levels.
--   Tier 2: facility levels whose parents are tier 1 levels
--   Tier 3: facility levels whose parents are tier 2 levels

-- Why even define tiers? Beds are associated with a facility level ID which may be either a cell or a

-- housing unit value of an incarceration period, but in cases where the facility level is actually a cell
-- this association no longer makes sense. Therefore, we create a mapping from any arbitrary facility level
-- to the top tier facility level in which it is placed in order to have a standard value for labeling
-- the housing unit.
