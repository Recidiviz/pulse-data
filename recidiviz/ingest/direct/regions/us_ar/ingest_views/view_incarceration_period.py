Incarceration periods are constructed using the following steps:
I. Identifying transition dates, which are the dates on which an incarcerated individual 
experiences a change in status (including the beginnings/ends of an incarceration term).
II. Unioning transitions of each type (external movement, bed assignment, and 
custody classification), deduplicating transitions that share a date, and sorting the
final set of transition dates.
III. Building periods by matching the sorted transition dates, which are processed and 
filtered to yield the view's output.

Some types of movements are recorded for people on supervision, usually right after 
a release from incarceration or before a violation return. Periods constructed from
those movements will be filtered out to ensure that people on supervision aren't

considered a facility (based on the following list of facility-type ORGANIZATIONTYPE

Admissions to backup jail facilities from parole may be special 90-day revocations, but
this isn't directly specified anywhere in the raw data. To identify these 90-day revocations,
we do the following:
- Get the admission movements that could potentially be 90-day revocations, based on their
  movement code and reason (return from ADC release/parole, with reason 'County/City Jail Backup')
- Join these movements with the person's board hearings, taking only the hearings that occur
  within 120 days of the admission movement. Note that this can be 120 days on either side,
  because there's often a delay in hearing data being recorded, resulting in hearing actions
  'occurring' after someone's already been committed.
- If any of these hearings include a '5E' action ('90 Day PV'), and none of them include a 
  '5F' action ('90 Day PV Removal'), then the movement is likely the result of a 90-day revocation. 
This CTE identifies the probable 90-day revocations, and we later join on this to set flag_90
to TRUE. This flag will stay TRUE until the person's next movement, and persists through
other non-movement transitions (so if someone on a 90-day revocation has their custody class 
changed without moving facilities, they will still be counted as a 90-day revocation because 
of the original movement.)

In some cases, the supervision start event occurs on the same day as the final pre-supervision
facility movement.  Since SUPERVISIONEVENT usually records dates and not datetimes, we 
simply add a second to the facility movement's datetime, ensuring that the inferred 
release to supervision doesn't show up before the movement into a facility. This creates
1-second long periods in the pre-supervision facility before the person is released; we
do this instead of replacing the facility movement entirely, in case it becomes useful to know 
what facility officially released someone to supervision.

/*
To avoid constructing duplicate/overlapping periods, transition data must be
deduplicated such that transition dates are unique at the person level. When there
are multiple types of transition on a given date, this CTE collapses them into a 
single transition. Different types of period information are handled differently:
person, date, and sequence number don't require processing as they will be the same
(since MOVE_SEQ is set using a RANK not ROW_NUMBER). Movement code, reason, and direction
are concatenated and separated by hyphens. Other data is taken from the transition
that specifies it: for example, if a bed assignment and custody assignment occur at the
same time, the location data is pulled from the bed assignment transition and the custody
level data is pulled from the custody assignment transition.
