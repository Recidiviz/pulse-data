file_tag: STATUSCHANGEHISTOR
file_description: |-
  Status change history. Provides a historical record for status fields that are updated 
  in place in their native tables, and therefore can only be viewed as a snapshot without
  using this table. 

  The STATUSRECTYPE column indicates the type of status being recorded, and the STATUSRECKEY
  is a free text column containing the relevant party's ID and some metadata (which appears 
  to usually be redundant with the status date/status time columns), separated by pipes. The
  status date and status code columns can be used to identify what the status was on a given date. 

  Note that STATUSRECTYPE is generally formatted differently from the actual name of the status
  column in the data, so to view the historical record for an update-in-place status column, 
  you must first determine how that status column's name is represented in this table.
