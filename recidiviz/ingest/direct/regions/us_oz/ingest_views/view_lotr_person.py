This file contains an ingest view related to us_oz_lotr data.

The view query takes data from three raw tables:
  - lotr_fellowship: Has basic person info
  - lotr_demographics: Has demographic info for each person
  - lotr_roles: Has aliases and roles for each person

These three tables will hydrate four entities:
  - state_person_external_id (simply using ID from each table)
  - state_person
  - state_person_race
  - state_person_alias
