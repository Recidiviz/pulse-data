"""Query produces a view for sentence status snapshotsâ€”points in time where a sentence status changes.
This includes:
  - Time of update
  - Type of status (COMPLETED, SERVING, REVOKED, COMMUTED, etc.)

Raw data files include:
  - LBAKRDTA_TAK025 to cross-reference sentences with sentence status snapshots
  - LBAKRDTA_TAK026 has the information for sentence status snapshots
