      Classification Score: The classification process is uniformly applied scoring, commencing upon reception of a person committed to the custody of the Secretary and continues throughout the time the individual remains under the Secretary's jurisdiction.  The classification process takes into consideration the inmate's needs, interests and desires, his/her behavior and placement score in keeping with the Department and institution's/facility's program and security missions and public safety.  Each determination affecting an inmate's placement within an institution or facility, transfer between facilities, program participation, privilege groups, or custody designation shall be made by a classification committee composed of staff knowledgeable in the classification process.  A lower placement score indicates lesser security control needs and a higher placement score indicates greater security control needs.

      California Static Risk Assessment (CSRA) The California Static Risk Assessment (CSRA) (new 12/09) is a validated risk assessment tool that utilizes a set of risk factors which are most predictive of recidivism. The tool produces a risk number value that will predict the likelihood that an offender will incur a felony arrest within a three-year period after release to parole. Risk factors utilized include, but are not limited to, age, gender, criminal misdemeanor and felony convictions, and sentence/supervision violations.

      CSRA risk falls in one of following five categories: (1) Low Risk. (2) Moderate Risk (3) High Risk Drug means that the offender has a greater risk of reoffending with a drug offense. (4) High Risk Property means that the offender has a greater risk of reoffending with a property offense. (5) High Risk Violence means that the offender has a greater risk of reoffending with a violent offense.
