file_tag: PVDTS_TreatmentReferrals
file_description: >-
  Contains information about individuals who were referred to non-DRP programming. This
  data technically contains referrals to programming which come from the PVDTS dataset
  administered by DAPO. We receive a subset of these referrals determined by the
  following filters: 

    1. Referrals to non-DRP programs only. This filter is applied by using a
       "IS_STATE_SPONSORED" field on CDCR side.
    2. Only referrals which appear to result in an actual program start. We do this by:
      2.1. Removing programs for which someone is on the waitlist.
      2.2. Using the "End_Reasons", I think we can filter by the "REASON_TYPE" field. I
           believe we want the following filters:
           | **Reason Type** | **Remove / Keep** |
           | --------------- | ----------------- |
           | END             | Keep              |
           | ENDPPP          | Remove            |
           | CANCEL          | Remove            |
           | PENDING         | Remove            |
           | IN_PRGS         | Keep              |
           | CLOSED          | Keep              |
           When the "Reason Type" is CLOSED, I am unsure if these programs were started
           or not, so we are keeping them for now and I will ask to remove them if we
           learn this is incorrect later.

      This field may or may not be valuable as is. It is often something like `RIVERSIDE
      BHR`, which is not very descriptive but still may be useful to end users.
      Othertimes, it is a concatenated name like `LIGHTHOUSE SOCIAL SERVICE CENTER -
      COLTON`. UXR is needed to understand what values might make more sense to end
      users. It's also often null -- we should ask about this.

      Futhernotes:
        1. BHR stands for BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REINTEGRATION. More can be read about this

      If this is a referral for a job, this is the employee who made the referral. It's
      currently `LastName ,FirstName` -- we would likely need to change this to
      BadgeNumber to actually be useful It's currently `LastName ,FirstName` -- we would
      likely need to change this to BadgeNumber to actually be useful.
