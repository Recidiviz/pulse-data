  - name: Program_Name

      The name of the program.
  - name: Program_Start_Date
    description: >-
      The date the program began. I think this refers to the date the program itself
      began -- it's possible this is earlier than the date when the client actually
      began the program, which is stored in Actual_StartDate. This needs to be confirmed
      with users however.

    description: >-
      The date the program ended. It's possible the client left this program on another
      date -- see Actual_EndDate.

      Same as ProgramName sometimes, perhaps when the program is a Residential or
      Live-In program?
