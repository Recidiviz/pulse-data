  if someone has absconded is by using the OffenderGroup field -- do not rely on
  AddressType.

      The unit the parolee is paroled in. Sometimes this is null for a week or two, then
      a unit appears here. This may be a transition period. I'm not sure what that means
      yet, or how ingest handles these currently. See TODO(#28585).

      This may be outdated 4/1: We need this information in addition to  BadgeNumber
      because some agents are active in multiple units, and this allows  us to
      understand which unit this individual is being supervised under (needs to be
      confirmed that this information is accurate). This is sometimes null as
      well.  This is being investigated here:
