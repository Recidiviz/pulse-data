    description: |-
      The unit the parolee is paroled in. Sometimes this is null for a week or two, then a unit appears here. This may be a transition period. I'm not sure what that means yet, or how ingest handles these currently. See TODO(#28585).
      This may be outdated 4/1: We need this information in addition to  BadgeNumber because some agents are active in multiple units, and this allows  us to understand which unit this individual is being supervised under (needs to be confirmed that this information is accurate). This is sometimes null as well.  This is being investigated here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1btF1k4KotghdKkAxjUNQOY9mYZcNnk1NL_t4XJyLm9w/edit#bookmark=id.vgjp81eb5voo
