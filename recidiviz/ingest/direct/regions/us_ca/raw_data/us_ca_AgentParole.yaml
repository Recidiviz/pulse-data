  This table contains general details about parole agents in California. Other
  state staff are also sometimes included in this list -- one should look at the
  AgentClassification to determine the role someone has. The primary key needs
  to include agent name because  sometimes badge number is null and it needs to
  include the Region/District/Unit information becuase agents are sometimes
  active in multiple units at once.

      The name of the parole agent.

  - name: BadgeNumber
    description: >-
      The badge number of the parole agent. There is an unwritten rule that if
      the badge number contains letters, that individual is a PSA (Parole
      Service Associate). At least some of those with 'null' badge numbers are
      PSAs. Some Parole Agents will have multiple badge numbers as well (it's
      unclear at the moment whether only one can be active at  once, or
      multiple). Further notes can be found here:

  - name: AgentClassification
    description: >-
      Classification of a parole agent. Refer to DAPO Agent Classifications on
      the CalHR website. It should be noted that this is not always accurate due
      to limitations (past and current) in the SOMS system. For example, PSAs
      are often classified as PA I within this column. It's better to rely on
      the badge number for this distinction, as noted in the BadgeNumber notes.
  - name: ParoleRegion
    description: >-
      The region that a parole agent works under. Parole Agents may work in
      multiple regions.
  - name: ParoleDistrict
    description: >-
      The district that a parole agent works under. Parole Agents may work in
      multiple districts.
  - name: ParoleUnit
    description: >-
      The unit that a parole agent works in. Parole Agents may work in multiple
      units.
