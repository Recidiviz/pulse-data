  This table contains general details about parole agents in California. Other state
  staff are also sometimes included in this list -- one should look at the
  AgentClassification to determine the role someone has. The primary key needs to
  include agent name because  sometimes badge number is null and it needs to include the
  Region/District/Unit information becuase agents are sometimes active in multiple units
  at once.

primary_key_cols:
  - ParoleAgentName
  - BadgeNumber
  - ParoleRegion
  - ParoleDistrict
  - ParoleUnit
columns:
  - name: ParoleAgentName
    description: >-
      The name of the parole agent.
    is_pii: True
  - name: BadgeNumber
    description: >-
      The badge number of the parole agent. There is an unwritten rule that if the badge
      number contains letters, that individual is a PSA (Parole Service Associate). At
      least some of those with 'null' badge numbers are PSAs. Some Parole Agents will
      have multiple badge numbers as well (it's unclear at the moment whether only one
      can be active at  once, or multiple).
    is_pii: True
  - name: EMAILADDRESS
    description: >-
      The email of the parole agent.
    is_pii: True
  - name: PhoneNumber
    description: >-
      The phone number of the parole agent (format: ###-###-####).
    is_pii: True
  - name: AgentClassification
    description: >-
      Classification of a parole agent. Refer to DAPO Agent Classifications on the CalHR
      website. It should be noted that this is not always accurate due to limitations
      (past and current) in the SOMS system. For example, PSAs are often classified as
      PA I within this column. It's better to rely on the badge number for this
      distinction, as noted in the BadgeNumber notes.
  - name: ParoleRegion
    description: >-
      The region that a parole agent works under. Parole Agents may work in multiple
      regions.
  - name: ParoleDistrict
    description: >-
      The district that a parole agent works under. Parole Agents may work in multiple
      districts.
  - name: ParoleUnit
    description: >-
      The unit that a parole agent works in. Parole Agents may work in multiple units.
