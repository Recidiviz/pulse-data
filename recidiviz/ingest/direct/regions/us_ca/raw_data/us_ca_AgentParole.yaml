file_description: |-
  This table contains general details about parole agents in California. Other state staff are also sometimes included in this list --
  one should look at the AgentClassification to determine the role someone has. The primary key needs to include agent name because 
  sometimes badge number is null and it needs to include the Region/District/Unit information becuase agents are sometimes active
  in multiple units at once.

      The badge number of the parole agent. If the badge number contains letters, it's possible they are actually a PSA. At least some of those with 'null'
      badge numbers are PSAs. Some Parole Agents will have multiple badge numbers as well (it's unclear at the moment whether only one can be active at 
      once, or multiple).
