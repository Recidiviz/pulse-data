          Defer to local adjudication as a new crime has been committed and their
          procedures will be followed. Because of this, revocation will not be pursued.

      - value: Good Cause
        description: >-
          This is usually a "stepping stone" state. When someone is referred for
          revocation and the supervising officer agrees, there is "good cause" for being
          referred for revocation. However, when this becomes someone's "final" state,
          we aren't sure what's happened -- we need the case notes or minute orders to
          understand. Likely a revocation?
