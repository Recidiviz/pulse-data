"""Query for supervision periods for US_TX.

    NOTE: 

    Texas sends supervision period data in a pretty counterintuitive way. It seems 
    that they join 5 separate tables using the period_ID_Number and this can lead to 
    records being joined together multiple times regardless of what is true at any given
    moment. In order to correct this, we treat the SupervisionPeriod table as if it was 5
    distinct tables each with it's corresponding fields and update time field. Here is 
    the breakdown:

    -[XREF_UPDATE_DATE]: SID_NUMBER, PERIOD_ID_NUMBER, DELETED_FLAG
    -[OSTS_UPDATE_DATE]: STATUS
    -[RMF_TIMESTAMP]: START_DATE, MAX_TERMINATION_DATE
    -[CTH_CREATION_DATE]: CASE_TYPE
    -[WTSK_UPDATE_DATE]: SUPERVISION_OFFICER
