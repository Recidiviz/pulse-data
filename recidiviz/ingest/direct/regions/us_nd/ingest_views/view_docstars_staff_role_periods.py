"""Ingest view for supervision staff role periods from the Docstars system.

The `docstars_officers` table that we receive is always a full
historical export, and has a field called `STATUS` to mark whether or
not officers are active or not. This view uses that field to close periods of an 
officer having a given role. Since the only role currently included in the
StateStaffRolePeriod entity in ND is `StateStaffRoleType.SUPERVISION_OFFICER`, 
these periods are proxies for an officer's employment. There should be no instances of 
officers having an open period while their `STATUS = 0.`
