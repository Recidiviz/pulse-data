"""Query containing offenses table information.

The raw data refers to offenses by either the legacy NCIC code or the Common Statute
NCIC Code. These are mututally exclusive - there are currently no rows in the raw data
that have both fields populated. The Common_Statute_NCIC_Code field stores legacy NCIC
codes, so these two fields are coalesced before being passed to the ingest mapping. 

The Common_Statute_Number field is populated in the raw data if and only if the CST code
is used, so it can be used to determine if a given row uses the legacy or CST system."""
