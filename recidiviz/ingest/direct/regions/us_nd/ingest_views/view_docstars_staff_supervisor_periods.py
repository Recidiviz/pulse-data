"""Ingest view for supervision staff employment location information from the Docstars system.

When an officer becomes inactive, their last supervisor period has an
end date, and there is no subsequent open period for that officer. The
start and end dates of supervisor periods are hydrated from the
`RecDate` field, which corresponds to the date the record was created in
the Docstars system.
