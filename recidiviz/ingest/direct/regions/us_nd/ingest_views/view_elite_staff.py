"""Query containing facilities staff information.

For the time being, this is a placeholder that ingests the StateStaffExternalId with an 
empty attached StateStaff entity. We do not receive any identifying information about
facilities staff except for IDs and names. TODO(#37707): Ingest staff emails.

Since these are currently only relevant in validations that ensure REFERRAL_STAFF_ID 
values match to state_staff values during ingest of state_program_assignment, the 
placeholder entities will be built using REFERRAL_STAFF_ID to ensure that a StateStaff
entity is created for each staff member who refers a resident to a program or course."""
