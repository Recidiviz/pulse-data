"""Query containing incarceration sentence information from the ELITE system.

Incarceration sentences are created from data combined from `elite_offendersentences` and `elite_offendersentenceterms`.
These contain different bits of information about a single sentence. There can be many terms
per sentence, and many sentences per booking.
