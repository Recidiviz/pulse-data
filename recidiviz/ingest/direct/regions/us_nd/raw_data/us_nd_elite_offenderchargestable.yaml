file_tag: elite_offenderchargestable
file_description: |-
  Each row represents a different offense that a person was charged with prior to being sentenced under DOCR jurisdiction.
  This includes metadata about the charge as well as some a reference to the court order under which the charge was tried
  and sentenced.

  Note that sometimes ND will update the `ORDER_ID` associated with an `(OFFENDER_BOOK_ID, CHARGE_SEQ)` pair. We currently
  do not support this and it will cause an invariant violation when the entity matching process will create a duplicate
  state charge object. ND says this should happen rarely, so we use a raw data migration to remove the offending rows.
  See https://github.com/Recidiviz/pulse-data/pull/8230 and https://github.com/Recidiviz/pulse-data/issues/5313
  for additional details.
