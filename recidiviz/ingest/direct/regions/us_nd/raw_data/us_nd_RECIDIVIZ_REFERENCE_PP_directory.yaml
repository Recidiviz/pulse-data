  The monthly Probation and Parole Directory received via email listserv from DOCR.
  OFFICER ID numbers were filled in by matching officers by name to docstars_officers 
  raw data, and subsequently by matching them to a provided list of officers with ID 
  numbers provided by ND.

  Query to match officers to their IDs:

  SELECT * EXCEPT (priority) FROM (
    SELECT 
    officers.OFFICER,
    roster.*, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY roster.LastName, roster.FirstName ORDER BY officers.STATUS) AS priority
  FROM <latest roster in a scratch bucket> roster
  LEFT JOIN `recidiviz-123.us_nd_raw_data_up_to_date_views.docstars_officers_latest` officers
  ON (TRIM(UPPER(roster.LastName)) = TRIM(UPPER(officers.LNAME)) 
    AND TRIM(UPPER(roster.FirstName)) = TRIM(UPPER(officers.FNAME)))
  WHERE roster.Section = 'Parole & Probation'
    AND FirstName IS NOT NULL AND FIRSTNAME != ''
    AND JobTitle != 'PSI Writer'
  )
  -- use most recent ID if an officer has had multiple
  WHERE priority = 1
  ORDER BY LastName

  To find the IDs for those that remain missing, open the spreadsheet titled "ND Supervision Staff IDs"
  at go/northdakota -> Ingest and match the missing staff members to their IDs manually.

  If there are still officers with missing IDs in the roster, reach out to the state to 
  clarify IDs and email addresses for those staff members.
