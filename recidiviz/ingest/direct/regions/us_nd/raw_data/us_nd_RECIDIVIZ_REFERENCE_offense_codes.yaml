  A static list of offense codes specific to North Dakota's Elite system. These represent basic metadata about the
  different kinds of offenses that one can be charged and sentenced with in the DOCR correctional system. These codes
  tend to apply only to charges that come from the Elite system and not the supervision-focused Docstars system, which
  is standardized around NCIC codes.
