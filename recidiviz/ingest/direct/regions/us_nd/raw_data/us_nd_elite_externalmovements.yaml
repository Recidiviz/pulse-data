  Each row represents a single movement of an incarcerated person from one incarceration facility to another, or in some
  cases to a different institution or to the outside world in the case of release. Sequences of rows in this table, for
  a given person and ordered by the MOVEMENT_SEQ, can be used to identify periods of incarceration.
