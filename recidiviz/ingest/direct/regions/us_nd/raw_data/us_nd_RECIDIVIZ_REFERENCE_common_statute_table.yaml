file_description: |-
  A reference table containing Common Statute Numbers and their descriptions, as found online
  at https://attorneygeneral.nd.gov/criminal-justice-resources/common-statute-table/

  The Common Statute Table (CST) is a list of offenses from North Dakota Century Code and 
  provides a common charging reference for criminal justice agencies. The CST is updated 
  in July of every odd numbered year to reflect legislative changes. Between legislative 
  sessions, the CST is updated once per month, as needed. When the CST is updated, a current, 
  full version of the CST is published as well as a file outlining just the changes from 
  the last release.

  These are used in the Docstars system, and should be prioritized over NCIC codes whenever
  possible. This raw data table should be updated periodically to account for changes.
