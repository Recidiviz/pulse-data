file_tag: elite_ProgramServices
file_description: |-
  Contains one row for each program or service provided by the DOCR. "Programs" and "services"
  can include job assignments and classes or other programming. 

  There is overlap between what is considered a program/service and what is considered a 
  course/activity; things that fall into both categories have both a PROGRAM_ID in this 
  table and a distinct CRS_ACTY_ID in the elite_courseactivities table, despite referring 
  to the same real-life experience.
