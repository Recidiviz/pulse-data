file_description: |-
  Each row represents a single person who has been or is currently under supervision. This contains basic demographic
  information about the person, as well as a variety of "roll-up" fields that Docstars rolls up from other tables into
  this one to capture the latest state of the field. These include metadata about a person's latest documented needs,
  latest assessment results, whether they are being revoked, whether they are absconding, supervision level, and more.

  SORAC assessment scores are provided as a "roll-up" field representing the most recent SORAC assessment for a person
  under supervision.

  Note: this table does not include historical record of this aforementioned data.
