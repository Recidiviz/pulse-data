file_tag: elite_OffenderProgramProfiles
file_description: |-
  Table that links people by their OFFENDER_BOOK_ID to the programs and courses they have 
  participated in, have been referred to, or have been rejected from or waitlisted for.
  Also tracks movements in and out of administrative segregation resulting from disciplinary
  or intervention needs assessments. Connects to elite_programservices and recidiviz_elite_CourseActivities 
  tables using PROGRAM_ID and CRS_ACTY_ID keys, respectively, for detail on institutional 
  activities.

  The combination of these three tables will replace elite_institutionalactivities, 
  which was a pre-joined, heavily-filtered version of these tables.
