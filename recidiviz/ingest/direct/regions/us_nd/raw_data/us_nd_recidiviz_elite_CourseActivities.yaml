file_tag: recidiviz_elite_CourseActivities
file_description: |-
  Contains one row for each course or activity engaged in within the ND DOCR. This includes
  work assignments, assessments, assignments to administrative segregation, and programming/courses,
  among other things.

  There is overlap between what is considered a program/service and what is considered a 
  course/activity; things that fall into both categories have both a CRS_ACTY_ID in this 
  table and a distinct PROGRAM_ID in the elite_programservices table, despite referring
  to the same real-life experience.
