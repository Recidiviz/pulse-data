file_description: |-
  Each row represents some activity (e.g. work assignment) or program (e.g. mental health treatment, educational program)
  undertaken by an incarcerated person. This includes metadata about the activity/program itself, when it was undertaken,
  their referral into the program, and free text notes about the person's participation.

  Importantly, DOCR has itself noted that the trustworthiness of this data is questionable, as it is a bit of a dumping
  ground for a lot of only loosely affiliated kinds of data and as it is not commonly kept up-to-date, i.e. many rows
  indicating that programs or activities from many, many years ago are still ongoing.
# Using these primary keys, there's a few dupes, only differing by end_date and offender_end_reason.
