file_description: |-
  Each row represents a "booking" into DOCR, i.e. a new series of interactions with the justice system due to a new
  offense. For example, a new booking is created when a person has their first ever conviction and sentencing under DOCR
  jurisdiction, or when a person who was previously incarcerated and is now at libery has a new conviction and sentencing.
  However, a new booking is not created when a person under supervision is revoked and sentenced back to incarceration.

  Each row contains some basic "roll-up" fields that are rolled up from other tables to give a snapshot of the current
  status of the booking.
