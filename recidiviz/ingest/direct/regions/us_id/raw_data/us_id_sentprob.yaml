file_tag: sentprob
file_description: |-
  Contains a new row for every probation sentence ever tracked by IDOC.

  This table can be joined with `sentence` to get some underlying details about the sentence. It’s important to note
  that this table contains its own probation start and end dates, which are often distinct from the start and end dates
  represented in the `sentence` table. The dates in this table represent how long the person is sentenced to
  supervision, and the dates in the sentence table represent how long the person would be sentenced if they were in
  prison / are revoked (often longer than the probation sentence). In Idaho terms, the dates in the `sentence` table
  are a part of the “underlying sentence”.

      Start date of probation. This can be backdated by judges to give a person credit for time already served.
      <br><br>        - ex. A person on probation goes into a rider and then back on probation. Instead of their
      probation officially restarting after their rider, the judge backdates their probation date to reflect their
      original start date. <br>        - ex. A person on probation violates some condition of their probation but is
      not revoked - a judge may “restart” their probation by moving their `prob_strt_dtd`
