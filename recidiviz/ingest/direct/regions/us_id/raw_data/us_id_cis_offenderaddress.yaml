file_tag: cis_offenderaddress
file_description: |-
  Contains a new row for each address span that a person under IDOC custody ever had.

  Each row should contain start and end dates to represent when the address was in use.
  This table does not tell you what type of address each of these rows represents nor where
  the address itself is, and it needs to be joined with `cis_personaddress` to get that
  information.
