file_tag: sentretn
file_description: |-
  Contains a new row for every retained jurisdiction sentence (aka Rider) ever tracked by IDOC. When someone is on a
  rider sentence, they are undergoing programming at a specific facility, and if that programming goes well, they are
  put onto probation rather than continuing to serve their sentence in prison. Although these sentences are served in
  a prison facility, the court technically has jurisdiction over them.

  This table can be joined with `sentence` to get some underlying details about the sentence. It’s important to note
  that this table contains its own rider start and end dates, which are often distinct from the start and end dates
  represented in the `sentence` table. The dates in this table represent how long the person is sentenced to their term
  as a rider, and the dates in the sentence table represent how long the person would be sentenced if their programming
  is not successfully completed. In Idaho terms, the dates in the `sentence` table are a part of the “underlying
  sentence”.
