  Contains a single row for every legal status span that a person under IDOC authority has ever had. It is possible for
  more than one status to be in use at a given time, although it is uncommon. From these legal statuses we get both
  supervision type information (probation, parole, investigation) and information around why the person is incarcerated
  (general incarceration, parole violation, rider)
