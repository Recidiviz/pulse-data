file_tag: early_discharge_sent
file_description: |-
  Contains a single row for each early discharge and sentence combination. When a decision about early discharge is
  made, it will be updated in this table. It’s important to note that decisions are made on a sentence level, and not
  necessarily on an early discharge request level (i.e. if 1 early discharge request was filled out for 2 sentences,
  one of the sentences could be discharged early and the other might not).
