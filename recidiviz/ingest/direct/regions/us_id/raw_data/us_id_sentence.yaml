file_description: |-
  Contains a new row for all sentences tracked by IDOC.

  This table can be joined with sent_prob to figure out which sentences are probation sentences. This table can also be
  joined with sent_retn to figure out which sentences are rider sentences. The rest of the sentences are “normal”
  incarceration sentences. It is common for many sentences to be appear on the same day. This happens when someone is
  sentenced to many cases at once.

  Other notes:

  - Certain status transitions will **always** result in a new sentence row being created. Those are:
      - Transition from Probation → Incarceration (whether on a “rider” or normal incarceration)
      - Transition from Incarceration → Probation (this transition should only happen if someone successfully completes
        a “rider”)
  - Whenever a sentence is officially amended (by a court order), a new row is created for the amended sentence. This
    new row is a snapshot of what the original sentence looked like before the changes. The new row has a sent_disp of
    `A` and an `am_sent_no` that corresponds to the original sentence. The original sentence gets the updated values.
      - important note: Sentence rows themselves can be updated without a separate, amended row. Only changes coming
        from a court order get a new row, all other changes are reflected on the original row.

      sentence id. <br><br>Note: This is an old system and only allows 40 rows per person. If they get over 40 rows
      manual intervention occurs which means either a) deleting the oldest sentence or b) deleting the
      “least important” sentence
  - name: off_dtd
    is_datetime: True
    description: |-
      Date of offense - the values in this column have highly variable formats, some of which are not easy or possible
      to parse as is, and some of which indicate date ranges that perhaps should not be reduced to a single date. As
      such, our ingest of this field is somewhat spotty -- we make our best effort.

    description: |-
      The first date that a person is eligible for parole. Takes into consideration any credits / forfeitures.
      <br><br>Note: It is possible that this date passes and the parole board rejects parole, but the person may be
      parole eligible again at a later date. Regardless, this date field does not change and will always reflect the
      first date a person is parole eligible.
  - name: sent_ind_dtd
    is_datetime: True
    description: |-
      Earliest date the person could be released onto supervision, if the person is given an indeterminate sentence.
      Takes into consideration any credits / forfeitures. <br><br>This is often the same as the sent_par_dtd; however,
      this field takes into account all sentences this person may have. That is to say if a person has 2 sentences, one
      with a parole date of Feb 1 and one with a parole date of Mar 1, both of those sentences would have an
      indeterminate date of Mar 1.
  - name: sent_ft_dtd

      Full term release date. Takes into consideration any credits / forfeitures.
  - name: sent_sat_dtd

    description: |-
      Date this sentence was completed. <br><br>Note: This field is often null. When a person is automatically moved to
      history, this field is not set. In that situation, can only tell the sentence ended if a person moves to history
      in the movement table.
  - name: am_sent_no
    description: |-
      If this is an amended sentence based on sent_disp, this am_sent_no points to the original sentence that it is
      amending (am_sent_no = sent_no of original sentence).
