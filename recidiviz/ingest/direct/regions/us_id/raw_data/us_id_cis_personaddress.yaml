file_tag: cis_personaddress
file_description: |-
  Contains a new row for each address that a person under IDOC custody ever had.

  These rows include address type and actual street address columns, but does not include
  start / end dates nor if the address had been validated. For that information, we must join
  with `cis_offenderaddress`

  Important note:

  - When an address is no longer in use, the column `codeaddresstypeid` is set to `HISTORY`. This means that we only
  have valid address types for currently used addresses.
