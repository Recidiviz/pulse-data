file_tag: ofndr_agnt
file_description: |-
  Contains a single row for every person on supervision and has their associated Parole/Probation officer (if known).
  When a person’s PO is updated, a new row is not created, but the existing row is updated. If a person ends
  supervision, we expect them to disappear from this table.


  We do not use this table, and instead use the `casemgr` table to understand PO assignments. This is for two reasons:

  1. This table does not have historical PO assignments, where as casemgr does.
  2. There are a few instances where this table and `casemgr` disagree, and in those instances, we’re told that
  `casemgr` is the source of truth.


  Note: On 2/17/2021, we discovered that `ofndr_agnt` and `casemgr` were disagreeing but that the data reported by
  `ofndr_agnt` was the one that matched POs' understanding of who was on their caseload. The error seemed to be in the
  copy of `casemgr` that was being sent to us, but in the event of future discrepancies, it is worth re-confirming with
  IDOC whether our data is correct.
