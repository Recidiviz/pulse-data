file_tag: casemgr
file_description: |-
  Contains a new row every time a person either a) has a new movement (see `movement` table) or b) has their assigned
  officer changed (can be a PO while on supervision or a case manager while incarcerated).


  The table `ofndr_agnt` also has PO information. The difference between these files is two fold:


  1.  `ofndr_agnt` only has the current POs (does not have historical data nor case managers for folks incarcerated).

  2. From Michele at IDOC, there are some cases where `ofndr_agnt` and `casemgr` disagree. In those cases,
  we should trust `casemgr` as the source of truth.
