# The goal of this query fragment is to create a single row per '(incarceration/supervision)period' as Recidiviz has
# defined it.
#
# In this case, it means we need to combine information from two tables: movements and offstat. `movements` is a
# ledger of all people's physical movements throughout the criminal justice system (i.e. moving prison facilities,
# districts, prison cells, etc). Offstat is a table which contains relevant status information about people. For
# purposes of determining incarceration/supervision periods, the most useful statuses are Rider (treatment in
# prison), investigative (not sentenced yet), and parole violator (temporary custody before parole board determines
# if a revocation should occur).
#
# With the information from these two tables, the goal is create a new row when someone changes facility or when
# their status changes.
#
# At a high level, our approach is:
# 1. Create time spans for each person's stay in a specific facility (prison facility or supervision district).
# 2. Create time spans for each person's "offender statuses", "parole officer assignments", and "supervision level"
# 3. Add all significant dates for a person (start/end dates of each facility the spans from part 2) into a single
#    view. These ordered dates signify dates at which something changed that indicates we need to create a new
#    incarceration period.
# 4. Create new time spans based on the important dates from part 3. This is a superset of the distinct
#    periods we want at the end. It is a superset, because a) it still includes time spans for a person on
#    supervision, but b) because includes spans for which a person is not currently under DOC custody, but is
#    between sentences (i.e. span between the end date of one sentence and the beginning of another).
# 5. Left join the time spans from part 4 to those of part 2. If multiple status spans from part 2 overlap with the
#    spans created in part 4, then all overlapping statuses are captured. Parole officer assignments and supervision
#    levels are joined at this time, although there should always be a maximum of 1 PO assignment or supervision level
#    for the generated time span.
# 6. Inner joins these new time spans from part 5 back onto the facility spans in part 1. Any span which represents
#    a time period where the person was not under DOC supervision will not have a facility, and therefore will fall
#    out of our query.
# 7. Use LEAD/LAG functions to get previous and next facility info for each row (this will later let us know more
#    info about in and out edges of periods. During this time also add a row number to each period.
