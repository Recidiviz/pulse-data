# MI categorizes the assessments they conduct into two categories: COMPAS assessments (which are developed and owned by Northpointe/Equivant)
# and non-COMPAS assessments (such as STATIC and STABLE).  COMPAS has its own database (the COMPAS database), so all COMPAS assessments data
# is stored there and will continue to be entered/stored there even with the introduction of COMS (the new data system that's coming)
# Some non-COMPAS assessments are also stored in the COMPAS database, but some non-COMPAS assessments are stored in other databases as well,
# and there's no standardized policy for where they should be stored.  Furthermore, with the introduction of COMS, some non-COMPAS assessments
# data is getting stored there too.  This query gathers all the assessment information that can be found in the COMPAS database, which should
# be sufficient for our upcoming needs since supervision level decisions only currently depend on COMPAS assessments (specifically the VFO recidivism
# risk and non-VFO recidivism risk scales).
