# In MI, there is a ADH_SUPERVISION_VIOLATION table which holds reports of supervision violation
# as well as a ADH_SUPV_VIOLATION_INCIDENT table which holds data on each incident.  Multiple incidents
# can be attached to the same record in ADH_SUPERVISION_VIOLATION so for our schema, we're going to count
# each incident as a single StateSupervisionViolation and each record in ADH_SUPERVISION_VIOLATION as a
# single StateSupervisionViolationResponse. There are cases where there's a record in the ADH_SUPERVISION_VIOLATION
# table but no associated incidents, and I think these are largely probation violations which MI research
# has said we should expect to be less documented in their data.  In those cases, we'll still have a StateSupervisionViolation
# and StateSupervisionViolationResponse constructed for them but leave many fields null.
#
# Then there's the ADH_MANAGEMENT_DECISION table which holds supervision officer level decisions/response while the
# ADH_SANCTION table holds other sanction responses.  Each row in either of these tables attaches to a record
# in ADH_SUPERVISION_VIOLATION and so we're going to count each as a StateSupervisionViolationResponse with an
# attached StateSupervisionViolationResponseDecision
#
# And finally the ADH_SUPER_COND_VIOLATION tells us about the violated condition, and each record attaches to a violation incident,
# which aligns with our schema.
