file_tag: CIS_215_SEX_OFFENDER_ASSESS
file_description: |-
  This table lists non-LSIR assessment results for a client. LSI assessments are found in CIS_116_LSI_HISTORY. The
  fact that this table is named for sex offense assessments is historical and no longer accurate. This includes both
  sex offense assessments and others. Nevertheless, there are columns that reference LSI ratings in this table, which
  appear to correspond to some sort of proxy rating for whatever assessment a given row in the file refers to, i.e.
  the results of these assessments are mapped to an LSI rating for normalized comparison against LSI assessments per
  MEDOC business logic.
