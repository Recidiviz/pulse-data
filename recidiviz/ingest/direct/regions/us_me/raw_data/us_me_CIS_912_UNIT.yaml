      The DOC Facility ID that this housing unit is associated with. This may not always be physically co-located, for example,
      the housing unit Southern Maine Women's ReEntry Center is listed as a unit within Maine Correctional Center, but it
      is located at an entirely different address. This is because of how the location was originally registered in the CORIS
      system.
