file_tag: Furloughs
file_description: >-
  This data comes from a query against tblFurlough. This is not just a two week diff,
  rather it includes all data. FurloughId is listed as primary key, though there appear
  to be around 5.1k rows which have a null FurloughId. We are not sure why this
  currently.

    description: >-
      Time the furlough began. Sometimes this looks like 1500, sometimes it is like
      3:00, sometimes it is 3:00 PM, so this is probably free text. Not always well
      formed.

  - name: SpecialConditions
    description: >-
      Free text description of conditions that apply while the person is on furlough. It
      seems semi-structured if we wanted to try to parse some info out of this, though
      likely not valuable for our work so far.

      Seems to most often describe the type of furlough. For example, if LUDescript is
      'Other', this field may specify that the furlough was to attend class. Also seems
      to often describe medical furloughs, but doesn't seem to add much if any
      addiitonal info.
    is_pii: True
  - name: LUDescript
    description: >-
      The purpose of the furlough. Not sure what LUDescript means though.

      Was deleted after 2023-10-17. It's possible LUDescript should actually be
      FurloughPurpose.
