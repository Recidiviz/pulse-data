file_tag: CIS_401_CRT_ORDER_HDR
file_description: |-
  This table includes information related to the client's sentence and is related to the CIS_319_TERM table.
  A term can have many sentences. The CIS_401_CRT_ORDER_HDR table is updated to include days earned or lost
  by time spent at the county jail awaiting sentencing, which then affects the early and current expected release dates
  on the term. This table also joins to the CIS_409_CRT_ORDER_CNDTION_HDR table and links a client to the conditions 
  imposed on their supervision sentence. The conditions are found in the CIS_403_CONDITION table.
