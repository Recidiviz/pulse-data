file_description: |-
  This table lists violations that occurred while someone was on community supervision. If a client was on SCCP
  (Supervised Community Confinement Program), the supervising officer might enter the violation info in either
  this table or in CIS_460_INCIDENTS, since they are still considered to be part of the incarcerated population.
