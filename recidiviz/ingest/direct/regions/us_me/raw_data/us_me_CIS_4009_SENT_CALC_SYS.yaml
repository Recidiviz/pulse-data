      The plain-text value associated with the Sent_Calc_Sys_Cd. Values represent a wide variety of kinds of information
      that are relevant to sentencing decisions. For example, values include such things as "Partial Revocation - with termination,"
      "Full Revocation," and "Violation Found - Conditions Amended," which indicate sentencing-style responses to a violation.
      There are other values like "10 year Registrant" and "Lifetime Registrant" which refer to consequences of a sex
      offense conviction. There are more values like "Consecutive" and "Concurrent" and still others like "Supervised" and
      "Unsupervised." Ultimately, the values from this column that are relevant will vary from context to context, i.e.
      from referencing table to referencing table.
