      The type of transer and whether it was in our outside of DOC jurisdiction. "Society In" is used for supervision and
      incarceration starts. "Society Out" is used for supervision and incarceration ends. Transfer types that begin
      with "Non-DOC" refer to people who are being transferred to a DOC Facility but have not been sentenced. This
      population includes people (referred to as "Safekeepers" or "Safe Keepers") who are entering the DOC Facility from the community or
      the state psychiatric facility due to the mental health resource needs. It also includes overflow population from
      county jails (referred to as "Boarders") who are awaiting court. Transfer types of "DOC County Jail Out" and
      "DOC County Jail Return From" refer to people who have served time in a County Jail, and are being transferred
      to DOC for probation time. This transfer type is primarily used by Probation Officers to keep track of people
      who will be added to their caseloads. The transfer type of "Society In" means the person is entering a DOC
      facility either as a new admission from society or from a county jail. The "Society Out" transfer type means the
      person is being transferred out of the DOC system entirely and into the community.
