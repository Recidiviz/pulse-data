file_tag: CIS_309_MOVEMENT
file_description: |-
  This table records movements to/from and between DOC facilities. It includes information about the movement type,
  status and direction. Movement types could refer to furloughs, admissions, transfers, releases to supervision,
  discharges to society, transports and escapes. The movement status refers to whether the movement is Pending,
  In Transit, Complete, or Cancelled. When a person is admitted to a DOC Facility, a movement record is auto-generated
  with a "Pending" status for their discharge or release date. When a person is released to supervision, two records are
  auto-generated: one with the movement type of "Release" from the facility and one with the movement type of
  "Transfer" to the supervision location. Transport movement types are when a person is being escorted to a location
  for the day either for work or medical reasons. When a movement is related to transfers or intakes
  (Sentence/Disposition, Transfer), a related record is generated in the CIS_314_TRANSFER table.
  Movement types of Furlough, Escape, Transport, Discharge, and Release do not generate transfer records.

      Whether the movement was in or out of a DOC facility. When someone is transferred between facilities, two records
      are auto-generated for the "In" and "Out" directions. The "To" and "From" locations are the same for both of these
      records, so we know from one of these rows that the person is being transferred "Out" of the Cis_908_Ccs_Location_Id
      and "In" to the Cis_908_Ccs_Location_2_Id.
