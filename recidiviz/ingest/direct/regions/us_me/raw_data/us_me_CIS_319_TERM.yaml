file_tag: CIS_319_TERM
file_description: |-
  A client is entered into the DOC on a "Term" that can include multiple charges or dispositions. This table shows
  for each term that a client has with the DOC: their intake date, max release date, and earliest release date,
  with all sentences/dispositions taken into account. Then it shows the status of whether the "Term" is still active
  or if it is complete. "Safekeepers" and "boarders" will not have a Term because they do not have a DOC sentence,
  though their status will be listed as incarcerated. Juveniles also may not have an associated term.
  A new "Society In" transfer record would generate a new Term record. This table is updated daily to reflect
  new early and current release dates that are affected by good time earned, lost, and restored.
