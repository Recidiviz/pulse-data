file_tag: CIS_124_SUPERVISION_HISTORY
file_description: |-
  This table records assignments for supervision officers. The Cis_908_Ccs_Location_Id field on this table
  more reliably represents a client's location than the location in the CIS_125_CURRENT_STATUS_HIST table. This is
  because someone could be assigned a new officer when moving locations and the officer updating the system may
  not create a transfer record in the CIS_314_TRANSFER table to reflect the change of location. A new record in the
  CIS_125_CURRENT_STATUS_HIST table is created when a transfer is created, and the current status location reflects the
  transfer location. Updates to the CIS_124_SUPERVISION_HISTORY table are not reflected in the CIS_125_CURRENT_STATUS_HIST
  table. It's not yet known how prevalant this mismatch in locations is.
