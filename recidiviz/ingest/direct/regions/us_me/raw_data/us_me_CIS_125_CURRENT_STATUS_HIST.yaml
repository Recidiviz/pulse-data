      Describes why someone was moved. Not all movements are transfers, but all transfers/transports are movements when they
      occur to/from a DOC Facility. Movements also include escapes and furloughs from DOC facilities.
      Movements are only related to incarcerated clients, not supervised clients. If a client is moved from
      incarceration to probation, there would be a record in both the movements and transfers tables.
