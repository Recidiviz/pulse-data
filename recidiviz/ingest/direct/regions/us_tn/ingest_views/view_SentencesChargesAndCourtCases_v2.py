"""This query pulls in from a number of different sentencing, statute, and charge tables in TN to produce one row per
sentence, charge, and court case. It includes both supervision and incarceration sentences, and pulls in external
identifiers other sentences the sentence may be consecutive to. It also creates a single charge object for each
sentence row, as well as a single court case with a single agent (judge).
