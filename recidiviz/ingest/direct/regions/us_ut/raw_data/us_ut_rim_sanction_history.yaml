file_tag: rim_sanction_history
file_description: |-
  This table contains all the statuse's associated with a violation and it's associated
  sanctions. A single violation event (identified by rim_ofndr_violation_event_id) can
  have multiple records in this table associated with it as the sanciton is considered.
  For example, it could be returned by BOPP, resubmited, the returned again before
  finally being accepted. That history is all encoded here -- I believe you can view the
  events in chronological order by looking at the created_dt field, as I did in the
  `violation` view.
