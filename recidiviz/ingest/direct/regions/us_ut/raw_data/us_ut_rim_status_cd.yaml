      This status is a human readable description of what's in the final_state_flg,
      pending_flg, and denied_flg.

    is_pii: True
  - name: final_state_flg
    description: |-
      Whether or not this state is final. It seems, however, that it's possible for this
      to be false while denied is true, and the decision is final.
  - name: denied_flg
    description: |-
      If the sanction decision is denied or not. I think that if this is true, and
      pending is false, the decision is final, but I'm not positive about this.
  - name: pending_flg
    description: |-
      Whether or not this decision is pending.
