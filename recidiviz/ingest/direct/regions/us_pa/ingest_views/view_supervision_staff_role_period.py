"""Query containing supervision staff role period information.

Starts with handmade roster and uses roles from there to capture the most accurate info 
possible for current employees. Fills in as many of the remaining officers' role info
as possible by using the column they appear in in the agent history data (Agent_EmpNum vs. Supervisor_EmpNum)
and PRL_AGNT_JOB_CLASSIFCTN in the supervision contacts data.

There are overlapping periods for officers who appear as supervisors and agents concurrently.
