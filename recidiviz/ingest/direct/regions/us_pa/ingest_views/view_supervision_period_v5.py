"""Query containing supervision period information.

Supervision periods are aggregated together from across the "Release" tables, namely `dbo_Release`, `dbo_ReleaseInfo`,
`dbo_RelStatus`, `dbo_RelAgentHistory`, and `dbo_Hist_Release`. These tables collectively include information on
"releases" from incarceration to parole, including changes in status and changes in supervising officer, supervision level, and supervision status for both
currently and previously supervised people.

Since probation is supervised by the county in PA, the vast majority of supervision periods in this view are parole periods.

Remaining known issues:
- There are some overlapping supervision periods due to some people having multiple ParoleNumbers that cannot be associated until ingest time (since PA IDs are complicated and require graph searching)
