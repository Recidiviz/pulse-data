file_description: |-
  This file is provided by PADOC and provides an entry for a supervision contact that was made.

  This table can have rows retroactively updated by agents with corrections between ingest dates
  as well as multiple rows within one ingest date that semantically represent the same contact made to
  a person on supervision.
  Fields such as METHOD, CONTACT_TYPE, ATTEMPTED, ASSISTED, COLLATERAL_TYPE are not included in this primary key due to
  evidence of retroactive updates to those fields. 
  PRL_AGNT_EMPL_NO is also relatively stable in combination to the four fields identified below but is excluded out of 
  possibility that it could transfer from one agent to another within PADOC.
  The four fields PAROLE_NUMBER, CREATED_DATE, CONTACT_TYPE, DURATION_MINS are identified as relatively stable to represent one contact 
  - CREATED_DATE may indicate a date later than START_DATE or END_DATE due to manual input by parole agents, but is hardly changed due 
  to every other adjustment after is a retroactive update to other fields. CONTACT_TYPE and DURATION_MINS, in this case, also hardly change, 
  but DURATION_MINS is included because there may be multiple of the same CONTACT_TYPE contacts created but for slightly different purposes.
