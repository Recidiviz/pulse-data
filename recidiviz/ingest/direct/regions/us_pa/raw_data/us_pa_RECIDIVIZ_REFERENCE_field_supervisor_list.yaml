file_description: |-
  Spreadsheet generated by hand from a PDF file that PA's data team sent on
  3/6/23. The original PDF is titled "Field Supervisors List" and contains all regional
  managers, district directors, district deputy directors, and unit supervisors in
  the state as of the date it was sent.

  Each row in this table represents one supervisor of one unit. Regional Directors are 
  included many times because they supervise many units in the same region. The secretary
  is listed once for each unit in the state, since he technically supervises all of them.
