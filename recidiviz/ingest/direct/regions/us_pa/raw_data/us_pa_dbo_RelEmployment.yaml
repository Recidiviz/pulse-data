file_tag: dbo_RelEmployment
file_description: |-
  A table describing specific periods of supervision currently being served by a particular person under the authority
  of PADOC. Release in this context refers to the release of a person from incarceration to supervision, though a
  minority of these rows include, for example, stints of probation being served in lieu of incarceration.

  This includes specifically the current employment status of person during this period and when the employment status
  came into effect. This table is typically joined with several other "Release" related tables that round out the
  picture of a period of supervision.

  NOT REFRESHED REGULARLY.
