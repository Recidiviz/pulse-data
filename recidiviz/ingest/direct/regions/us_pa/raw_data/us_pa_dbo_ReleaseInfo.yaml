file_tag: dbo_ReleaseInfo
file_description: |-
  A table describing specific periods of supervision currently being served by a particular person under the authority
  of PADOC. Release in this context refers to the release of a person from incarceration to supervision, though a
  minority of these rows include, for example, stints of probation being served in lieu of incarceration.

  This includes a wide variety of kinds of metadata, including the supervision officer and field office, the offenses
  that this period of supervision was sentenced for, and more. This table is typically joined with several other
  "Release" related tables that round out the picture of a period of supervision.
