file_tag: offense_codes
file_description: |-
  A PADOC-provided table containing a list of all offenses that a person can be convicted
  and sentenced for within the Pennsylvania justice systems, with various bits of
  metadata about those offenses. Each offense has a "Code" which is a unique identifier
  that is referenced from other tables, such as dbo_Senrec.offense_code.

  This file was initially provided one time as a static transfer in November 2020. If it
  is transferred again, it should be manually updated in us_pa_raw_data.

primary_key_cols:

columns:
  - name: ReviewFlag
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether this offense code is under review by PADOC.
  - name: Code
    description: |-
      The unique code identifying a single offense in PADOC. This code can also be thought of as
      a "statute" number for purposes of identifying an offense among systems.
  - name: Offense
    is_pii: True
    description: |-
      A string describing the offense. This is sometimes a short and simple string, like "Theft."
      It is sometimes a longer string with more detail. But it is not "free text" in the typical
      sense, since it is consistently formatted and does not contain long paragraphs.
  - name: Category
    description: |-
      A string describing the type of offense, such as "DUI" or "DRUGS" or "FRAUD".
  - name: ASCA_Category___Ranked
    description: |-
      A separate taxonomy for categorizing offenses, with a smaller set of consistent values.
      Each value is in the format of "[digit]-Words", e.g. "1-Violent" or "2-Property".
      All violent offenses in this file have a value of "1-Violent" for this column.
  - name: SubCategory
    description: |-
      A string providing extra detail about the type/category of offense, such as "VIOLENT-PROPERTY"
      or "SEX OFFENSE" or "HOMICIDE". This can be null.
  - name: AddDt
    description: The date the offense code was added to this PADOC-internal table.
    is_datetime: True
  - name: Grade_Category
    description: The charge classification, i.e. FELONY or MISDEMEANOR (or null in rare cases).
  - name: Grade
    description: |-
      The charge sub-classification, e.g. "F1" or Felony 1st Degree or "M2" for Misdemeanor
      2nd Degree. This may also include simply "F" or "M" where there is no further sub-classification
      or even "S" which indicates a "Summary Offense" that typically carries penalties
      lighter than felonies or misdemeanors (such as "Disorderly Conduct" or "Underage Drinking").
