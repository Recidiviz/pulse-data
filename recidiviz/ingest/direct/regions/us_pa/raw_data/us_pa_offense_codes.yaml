file_description: |-
  A PADOC-provided table containing a list of all offenses that a person can be convicted
  and sentenced for within the Pennsylvania justice systems, with various bits of
  metadata about those offenses. Each offense has a "Code" which is a unique identifier
  that is referenced from other tables, such as dbo_Senrec.offense_code. This table
  is not provided regularly: it was provided a single time in a manual send by PADOC
  in November 2020.
