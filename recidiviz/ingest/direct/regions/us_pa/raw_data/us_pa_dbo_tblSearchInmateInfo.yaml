file_tag: dbo_tblSearchInmateInfo
file_description: |-
  A table that acts as a "roll-up" for various bits of information about a person who is currently or was previously
  incarcerated under the authority of PADOC. It consolidates information from a variety of tables to provide a single
  interface to understanding the status of a person.

  Because Recidiviz ingests the underlying tables directly, Recidiviz uses this table specifically to tie together
  identifiers that otherwise are difficult to tie together, using it as a reference table. This permits the ability to
  reliably match people records which are located in DOC tables with people records which are located in PBPP tables.
