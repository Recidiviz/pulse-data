file_description: |-
  A table containing demographic and identifier information for people who have been incarcerated by PADOC.

  In addition to basic demographics and identifiers, this table also acts as a "roll-up" table for a variety of bits of
  information contained in other PADOC tables, in order to serve as a quick interface for understanding the current
  state of the person.

  A large majority of the fields in this table are unused by Recidiviz, particularly those which delve into highly
  sensitive information about a person.
