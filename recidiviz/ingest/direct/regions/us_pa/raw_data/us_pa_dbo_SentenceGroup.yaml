file_tag: dbo_SentenceGroup
file_description: |-
  A table containing "roll-up" information about all sentences in a group of sentences to incarceration or supervision
  to be served under the authority of PADOC. Because probation is administered almost entirely at the county level in
  Pennsylvania and PADOC/PBPP primarily deals with parole, the majority of sentences in this table are sentences to
  incarceration that in turn led to releases to parole. Consequently, much of this information is redundant of the
  information directly from the DOC side of PADOC via `dbo_Senrec` and may not be as reliable/consistent.
