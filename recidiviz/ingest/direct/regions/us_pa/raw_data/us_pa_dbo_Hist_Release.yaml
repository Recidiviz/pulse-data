file_tag: dbo_Hist_Release
file_description: |-
  A table describing specific periods of supervision that were served in the past by a particular person under the
  authority of PADOC. Release in this context refers to the release of a person from incarceration to supervision,
  though a minority of these rows include, for example, stints of probation being served in lieu of incarceration.

  This table is the historical version tying together all of `dbo_Release`, `dbo_ReleaseInfo`, `dbo_RelStatus`, and
  `dbo_RelEmployment`. When a period of supervision is terminated and the person is now at liberty or has been convicted
  of an entirely new offense with entirely new and separate sentences, the records from the aforementioned tables are
  consolidated together into a row in this table.
