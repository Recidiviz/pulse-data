file_description: |-
  Recidiviz-generated mapping of PA supervision organization codes to the suboffice, district, and region ids and human
  readable names. This file is generated from other raw files we receive from PA but we don't expect it to update
  regularly. If we find that there is a new org code not included in this table, we should generate a new version using
  the following query:
