file_description: |-
  Recidiviz-generated mapping of PA supervision organization codes to the suboffice, district, and region ids and human
  readable names. This file is generated from other raw files we receive from PA but we don't expect it to update
  regularly. If we find that there is a new org code not included in this table, we should generate a new version using
  the following query:

      The organization code associated with a supervision site. This could be a supervision
      unit, a supervision district, or a region.
      A supervision unit is the smallest level of supervision location grouping we currently know about in PA.
      A supervision district is a set of supervision units with shared leadership (District Director and Deputy District Director).
      A supervision region is a set of supervision districts with shared leadership (Regional Director).
