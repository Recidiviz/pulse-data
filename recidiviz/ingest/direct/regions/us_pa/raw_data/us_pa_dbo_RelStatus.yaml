file_tag: dbo_RelStatus
file_description: |-
  A table describing specific periods of supervision currently being served by a particular person under the authority
  of PADOC. Release in this context refers to the release of a person from incarceration to supervision, though a
  minority of these rows include, for example, stints of probation being served in lieu of incarceration.

  This includes specifically the current supervision status of the period and when the status came into effect.
  This table is typically joined with several other "Release" related tables that round out the picture of a period of
  supervision.
