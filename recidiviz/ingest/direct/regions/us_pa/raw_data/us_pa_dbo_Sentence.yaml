file_tag: dbo_Sentence
file_description: |-
  A table containing sentences to incarceration or supervision to be served under the authority of PADOC. Because
  probation is administered almost entirely at the county level in Pennsylvania and PADOC/PBPP primarily deals with
  parole, the majority of sentences in this table are sentences to incarceration that in turn led to releases to parole.
  Consequently, much of this information is redundant of the information directly from the DOC side of PADOC via
  `dbo_Senrec` and may not be as reliable/consistent.
