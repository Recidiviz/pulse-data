  A table containing information about each agent and supervisor at PBPP. This is emailed
  to us from PA in a google sheet as two separate tabs: "Agents" and "Supervisors", and 
  requires preprocessing. Each tab is manually corrected to guarantee the following things: 
    - All individuals listed as an agent's supervisor are included in the "Supervisors" tab,
      with the same spelling and formatting of their name.
    - The SupervisorInfo field in the "Agents" tab is split into components so that supervisors 
      can be matched to their ID numbers using their first and last name.
    - All individuals have an Employee ID.
    - The column names match the column names in this configuration.

  The "Supervisor" and "Agents" tabs are concatenated to form one table, which is called
  "All Staff". Then the following query is run on that table to join supervisor IDs to 
  supervisor names.

  ```
  SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        all_staff.*,
        supervisors.EmployeeID AS Supervisor_EmpNum, 
    FROM <ALL STAFF TABLE> all 
    LEFT JOIN <SUPERVISORS TAB> supervisors
    -- join on supervisor name to get supervisor ID
    ON (CONCAT(TRIM(UPPER(all.SupervisorFirstName)), TRIM(UPPER(all.SupervisorLastName))) 
        = CONCAT(TRIM(UPPER(supervisors.EmployeeFirstName)), TRIM(UPPER(supervisors.EmployeeLastName))))
    )
    ORDER BY EmployeeID;
  ```

  To join caseload types: 
  ```
  SELECT DISTINCT 
    all.*, special.AgentType,  
  FROM <ALL STAFF TABLE WITH SUPERVISOR IDS> all
  LEFT JOIN <SPECIALTY AGENTS ROSTER> special
  ON(LPAD(PosNo6, 6, '0') = AMU_POS_NO)
  ```
