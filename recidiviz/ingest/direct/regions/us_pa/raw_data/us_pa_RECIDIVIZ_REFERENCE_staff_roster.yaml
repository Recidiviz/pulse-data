  See this description with slightly more detail in "PA Staff Roster 101" at go/pennsylvania. 

  Roughly once a month, we receive a current roster for supervision field staff via email, 
  including everyone from parole agents to district directors. 

  The format has changed at least slightly each time we have received a roster. 
  It seems like with time, the changes will slow and the state will settle on a final 
  format. Once that happens, the preprocessing on our end will likely become easier. 
  For now, it is relatively manual and requires a decent amount of spot-checking.

  The roster is originally in a Google sheet. Each agent, supervisor, and state leader
  theoretically has their own row in the table, with their own information and supervisor
  in it. Folks in upper management tend to not have their own rows; when they do, they
  often don’t include supervisor information.

  In order to get from the Google sheet to something suitable to be uploaded to GCS 
  and ingested as raw data using this config, follow the steps below.

  Step 1. Download the roster from Google Sheets.
  Step 2. Rename columns as needed so they match those in this raw data configuration. 
  If there are any empty extra columns, delete them so the CSV is not malformed.
  Step 3. Save the spreadsheet as a CSV and upload it to a scratch dataset in BQ. 
  Step 4. Check for missing information. To discern which employees are listed as 
  supervisors but not included in their own row in the table, you can run this query: 

          SELECT * FROM (
              SELECT DISTINCT
                  all_staff.SPVR_POS_NO AS Pos_No,
                  all_staff.SUPERVISOR_LASTNAME as as_supervisor_lname, 
                  all_staff.SUPERVISOR_FIRSTNAME as as_supervisor_fname,
                  supervisors.Emp_Last_Name as unique_row_lname, 
                  supervisors.Emp_First_Name as unique_row_fname,
                  supervisors.Emp_No 
              FROM <ORIGINAL ROSTER> all_staff
              LEFT JOIN <ORIGINAL ROSTER> supervisors
              ON (all_staff.SPVR_POS_NO = supervisors.Pos_No)
              )
          WHERE Emp_No IS NULL;

  This will almost always include state leaders. Up until this point, we haven’t needed 
  to ingest the State Director or Regional Directors as staff, so it has been okay that 
  they don’t have their own rows in this roster. This may change with development of the
  Insights web tool, in which case we will need to ask for their Employee IDs. 
  An SEM or PM can provide their email addresses. These pieces of information will need 
  to be filled into the roster by hand if they are deemed necessary and can’t be included
  in the original roster. 

  If any supervisors who are not on the leadership level appear in the results above, 
  you should ask the state for their information before continuing the process. 
  The missing information will typically come in an email, and will need to be added by 
  hand to the original roster.

  Step 5. Once you have a complete roster uploaded to a scratch dataset in BQ, add a column 
  for supervisor employee IDs. There will be three versions of the roster in the bucket
  by the end of the process, and only one will be suitable for upload, so make sure you
  give them easily differentiable names. 
         
          SELECT 
            all_staff.*,
            supervisors.Emp_No as Supervisor_EmpNum
          FROM <ORIGINAL ROSTER> all_staff
          LEFT JOIN <ORIGINAL ROSTER> supervisors
          ON (all_staff.SPVR_POS_NO = supervisors.Pos_No)

  Step 6. Join caseload types using Position Numbers and the `pa_specialty_agents`` 
  reference table.
                
          SELECT DISTINCT 
            all_staff.*, 
            special.AgentType,  
          FROM <ROSTER WITH SUPERVISOR IDS> all_staff
          LEFT JOIN recidiviz-123.us_pa_raw_data_up_to_date_views.specialty_agents_latest special
          ON(LPAD(all_staff.Pos_No, 6, '0') = LPAD(special.PosNo6, 6, '0'))

  Step 7. Download the final roster - with supervisor Employee IDs, caseload types, 
  and properly named columns - and upload it as raw data.
