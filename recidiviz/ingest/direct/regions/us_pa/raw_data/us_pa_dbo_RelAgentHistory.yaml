file_tag: dbo_RelAgentHistory
file_description: |-
  A table describing transfers between supervising agents for specific periods of supervision presently or previously
  served under the authority of PADOC. Release in this context refers to the release of a person from incarceration to
  supervision, though a minority of these rows include, for example, stints of probation being served in lieu of
  incarceration.

  This table is typically joined with several other "Release" related tables that round out the picture of a period of
  supervision.
