file_tag: dbo_Release
file_description: |-
  A table describing specific periods of supervision currently being served by a particular person under the authority
  of PADOC. Release in this context refers to the release of a person from incarceration to supervision, though a
  minority of these rows include, for example, stints of probation being served in lieu of incarceration.

  This includes when the period of supervision began and the type of supervision is being served. This table is
  typically joined with several other "Release" related tables that round out the picture of a period of supervision.
