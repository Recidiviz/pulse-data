  # Each set of violations and responses begets a single `state_supervision_violation`
  # instance with one to many child `state_supervision_violation_type_entry`
  # instances, each of the latter corresponding to a `dbo_SanctionTracking` row with
  # `Type='V'`. Additionally, for each such `Type='V'` row with a unique `SanctionCode`
  # value, a new `state_supervision_violated_condition_entry` child instance
  # will be created. It is possible to have multiple such rows in a set with the same
  # `SanctionCode` if there are multiple associated violations of the same condition.

  # Each set begets a single `state_supervision_violation_response` instance with one
  # to many child `state_supervision_violation_response_decision_entry`
  # instances, each of the latter corresponding to a `dbo_SanctionTracking` row with `Type='S'`.

  # These sets also include "decision" rows which have less rich information and which PADOC has informed us are not
  # particularly useful, so are ignored.
