# A recent change to Paramiko defined a preference order for algorithms that are used to
# decrypt host keys and private keys. For RSA keys, we have identified that these two
# algorithms take precedent over ssh-rsa, which is the algorithm preferred by state
# partners. Therefore, if there are other channel closed errors, we should consider
# adding algorithms to this list in order to force preference of the algorithms that our
# hostkey secrets contain by our state partners.
