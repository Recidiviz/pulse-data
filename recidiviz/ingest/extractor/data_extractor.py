"""A module which takes any content and extracts from it key/value pairs that
a user might care about.  The extracted information is put into the ingest data
model and returned.

DataExtractors are initialized with two categories of keys: single-value keys
(|self.keys|) and multi-keys (|self.multi_keys|). Single-value keys have one
value per unit of data: for example, a page might have one 'DOB' field per
table. Multi-key values are extracted from the content in a sequence: for
example, a page might have a table with 'Charge Name' and 'Bond Amount' columns,
such that the association of charge name and bond amount is inferred by their
order (so the fifth bond amount corresponds to the fifth charge).

Implementations of the DataExtractor walk through structured content and call
_set_or_create_object, which builds an IngestInfo incrementally. The behavior of
this method is different for single-key values and multi-key values, and will
either set a single value or a list of values on the most recent object or
list of objects; or create new objects as needed.
