"""Defines a criteria view that shows spans of time for which supervision clients
need an employment verification task completed. This happens in the following cases:
- The client is able to work (is_able_to_work criteria is met)
- The client needs an initial verification (within 30 days of starting supervision)
- The client needs a re-verification (every 30 or 60 days after the last verification)
