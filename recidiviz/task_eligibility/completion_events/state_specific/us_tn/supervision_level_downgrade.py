"""Identify when a TN client's supervision level has been downgraded, excluding
downgrades to limited supervision (Compliant Reporting).

In TN, changes to supervision levels are generally backdated or postdated to the 1st of
the month. To work around the backdating (which can make it appear in the data as if a
client's level was changed before they actually experienced that change in real life),
we incorporate data from `SupervisionPlan` to infer the date on which an officer
actually initiated the downgrade. We don't try to work around postdating because we are
interested in tracking when the client actually experienced the transition, and in cases
of postdating, the client still wouldn't experience the transition until the later date.
