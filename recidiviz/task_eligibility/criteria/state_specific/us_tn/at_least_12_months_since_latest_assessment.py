            to begin on classification_decision_date; this ensures that someone will continue to show up as eligible 
            even after a form has been submitted for them, until the final hearing is done and a decision is made.
            
            We want the span to end 12 months after the ClassificationDate, as per what Counselors have told us they use
            to evaluate when a person needs an annual reclass.
            
            Since a person is considered "eligible" during the whole month where their assessment is due, we use a
            DATE_TRUNC() for the end date so that someone becomes eligible in the month of their assessment due date.
            
            This also improves tracking historical spans in situations when an annual assessment may be filled out
            prior to the due date, since we consider someone eligible the starting the first of the month when their
            assessment is due
