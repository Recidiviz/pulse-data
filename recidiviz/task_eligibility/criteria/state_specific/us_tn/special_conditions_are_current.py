logic of when a special conditions contact is due depends someone's supervision level. This criteria ultimately produces
spans of time when the next special conditions contact was not overdue. This might mean there are no special conditions,
conditions are terminated, or they are current. Note, these spans are only defined for people on Minimum or Medium (not
PSU) supervision levels, since those are the ones relevant for Compliant Reporting. If these contact standards change,
the variables below will need to be updated.
