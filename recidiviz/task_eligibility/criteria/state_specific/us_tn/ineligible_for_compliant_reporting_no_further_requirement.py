        combined with the "required" criteria in the transfer_to_compliant_reporting_with_discretion view, this allows
        us to identify people who are almost eligible (1 criteria away) AND may require some discretion.
        
        There is added complexity in the determination of people who are overdue or coming up for full term discharge.
        If someone fails to meet the SUPERVISION_NOT_PAST_FULL_TERM_COMPLETION_DATE_OR_UPCOMING_90_DAYS criteria, 
        but also fails to meet HAS_ACTIVE_SENTENCE or US_TN_NO_ZERO_TOLERANCE_CODES_SPANS, 
        then they will show up as is_eligible = FALSE in transfer_to_compliant_reporting_no_discretion and
        is_eligible = TRUE in transfer_to_compliant_reporting_with_discretion. This is what we want, because
         we don't actually think they are overdue or coming up for discharge. Thus, they can then be considered eligible 
        for compliant reporting (with discretion, since failing to meet HAS_ACTIVE_SENTENCE or 
        US_TN_NO_ZERO_TOLERANCE_CODES_SPANS also suggests missing sentencing info that could be relevant).
        
        However, if someone fails to meet the SUPERVISION_NOT_PAST_FULL_TERM_COMPLETION_DATE_OR_UPCOMING_90_DAYS criteria,
        but meets both HAS_ACTIVE_SENTENCE AND US_TN_NO_ZERO_TOLERANCE_CODES_SPANS, then they will also show up as
        is_eligible = FALSE in transfer_to_compliant_reporting_no_discretion, which is correct because we think they are
        actually overdue for discharge/upcoming discharge. In that case, we also want is_eligible = FALSE in 
        transfer_to_compliant_reporting_with_discretion, which is why we make the exception below.
