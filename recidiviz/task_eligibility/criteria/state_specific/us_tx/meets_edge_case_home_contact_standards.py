"""Defines a criteria view that shows spans of time for which supervision clients
are compliant with edge case home contacts. The following edge case are as follow:

- "A home contact and residence validation are required within 30 calendar days of the initial
office contact for a newly released or transferred client, unless otherwise specified in
Section VII. For a client on normal reporting status, home contacts are required and are
based on their assigned TRAS supervision level and caseload type. Two separate OIMS
contact entries are not required if the home contact and residence validation occur on the
same day and the client was present."

- "A home contact is required within 30 calendar days of a client`s change of address."

- "The PO shall conduct a home contact within five business days after a client is returned
to supervision from any correctional facility, such as a TDCJ-Correctional Institutions
Division (CID) unit, TDCJ state jail, Intermediate Sanction Facility (ISF), Substance
Abuse Felony Punishment Facility (SAFPF), or county jail."
