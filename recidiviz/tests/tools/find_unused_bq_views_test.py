                Found the following views that are not used by any known downstream product: \n{BigQueryAddress.addresses_to_str(unused_addresses, indent_level=18)}.

                In order to address this failure, you can do the following:
                1) If this view is no longer needed, delete it in this PR.
                2) If this view is no longer needed but there is a reason why you want to delete it in 
                  a later follow-up PR (e.g. because there are a lot of views to delete, you want to 
                  validate your change first, etc), add the address to 
                  UNREFERENCED_ADDRESSES_TO_KEEP_WITH_REASON with your name, date, and a comment that includes
                  a linked cleanup task.
                3) If this is a new view that will soon be used in a product view, add the address to 
                  UNREFERENCED_ADDRESSES_TO_KEEP_WITH_REASON with your name, date, and a comment that includes
                  a linked task that encompasses the work to use this new view downstream. This view
                  should be removed from UNREFERENCED_ADDRESSES_TO_KEEP_WITH_REASON once it does have a
                  downstream product use.
                4) If this view is still in use in LOOKER and cannot be deleted, add the address to 
                  LOOKER_REFERENCED_ADDRESSES.
                5) If you do not think your failure falls under any of these cases, please reach out to
                  Doppler in the #platform-team channel.
