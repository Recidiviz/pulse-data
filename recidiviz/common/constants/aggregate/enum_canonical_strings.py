"""Strings used as underlying representation of enum values for aggregate-
specific application and database code.

NOTE: Changing ANY STRING VALUE in this file will require a database migration.
The Python values pointing to the strings can be renamed without issue.

SQLAlchemy represents SQL enums as strings, and uses the string representation
to pass values to the database. This means any change to the string values
requires a database migration. Therefore in order to keep the code as flexible
as possible, the string values should never be used directly. Storing the
strings in this file and only referring to them by their values here allows
us to structure the application layer code any way we want, while only
requiring the database to be updated when an enum value is created or removed.
