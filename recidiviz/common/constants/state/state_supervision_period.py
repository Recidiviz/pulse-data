    "warrant when an individual on supervision violates the rules of the court, most "

    "portion of their sentence, and are doing so confined in the community instead of "
    "in prison. Any information about the location of the person is captured in the "

    "supervision where a person has not yet been sentenced. A person may be on "
    "investigative supervision between their arrest and trial, or between their "
    "conviction and sentencing hearing. During this time the person is often "
