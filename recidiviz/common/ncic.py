"""
Common utility functions used to access NCIC codes.

NCIC codes are national standard codes for offenses as tracked in the central
National Crime Information Center database. They are 4-digit codes that are
organized into blocks by the hundreds, such that similar offenses are colocated.
Different justice agencies around the nation may have their own offense codes,
statute numbers, and so forth, but many of them will also have a reference to
the central NCIC codes.

The `data_sets/ncic.csv` file contains a list of NCIC codes, their descriptions
(as provided by North Dakota DOCR), and whether or not these are considered to
be violent offenses.

No judgements are made as to the contents of the list and the descriptions of
certain offenses. This is a reference tool.
