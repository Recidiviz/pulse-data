"""
Common utility functions used to manipulate jurisdiction_ids.

Jurisdiction Ids are unique identifiers (ints) which are mapped 1:1 to each
jurisdiction in the United States. Each Jurisdiction Id starts with the FIPS
county code that that jurisdiction falls into. This means that a single
jurisdiction may map to multiple jurisdiction_ids if that jurisdiction falls
into multiple counties.

The `data_sets/jid.csv` file contains a mapping of (agency_name, state)
to jurisdiction_id. It's important to note that when joining scraped data with
a jurisdiction_id, we must take the county's state into account since
multiple states share the same county names.
