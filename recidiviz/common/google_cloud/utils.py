    The requirements for values are that they can contain only lowercase letters, numeric
    characters, underscores, and dashes, and have a maximum length of 63 characters:
            https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/labels-overview#requirements
    This formatting *should* be valid across all GCP services, such as compute engine
    labels and BigQuery job labels.

    This method converts the label string to lowercase, replaces any disallowed characters
    with a dash, and truncates the length to 63.
