: "Script to deploy the Justice Counts application to staging for playtesting.
Performs the following actions:
1) Runs our Cloud Build Trigger to build a Docker image off of the specified branches
   in pulse-data and justice-counts.
2) Deploys a new Cloud Run revision from this image without allocating traffic,
   but with the specified tag.

Note: If your branch includes a database migration, this script does not run the migration. 
The migration will be run when the commits from your branch are deployed to staging. 

Example usage:
./recidiviz/tools/deploy/justice_counts/deploy_for_playtesting.sh -b main -f settings-feature -a publisher -t playtesting
