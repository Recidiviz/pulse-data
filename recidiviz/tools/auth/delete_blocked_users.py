Tool for deleting product users who have been blocked for at least 30 days. Blocking can
occur either via the admin panel or during roster sync. During roster sync, if an existing
user is not included in the ingested file, their block date is set, their information is 
copied to the UserOverride table, and they are removed from the Roster table. If they 
are still not in the Roster table 30 days after they are blocked, we can assume that they 
should no longer have access and can be deleted. Users are deleted from both UserOverride
and PermissionsOverride to prevent accidental reassignment of previous permissions if the user
is ever re-added.

The script can be run against a local database or against one running in Cloud SQL. The
script will prompt for confirmation with a list of affected users before deleting.

Usage against default development database (docker-compose v1) after `docker-compose up` has been
run: docker exec -it pulse-data_admin_panel_backend_1 pipenv run python -m
recidiviz.tools.auth.delete_blocked_users --state_code US_XX

Usage against default development database (docker-compose v2) after `docker-compose up` has been
run: docker exec -it pulse-data-admin_panel_backend-1 pipenv run python -m
recidiviz.tools.auth.delete_blocked_users --state_code US_XX

To run against Cloud SQL, specify the project id: python -m
recidiviz.tools.auth.delete_blocked_users --project_id recidiviz-staging --state_code US_XX
