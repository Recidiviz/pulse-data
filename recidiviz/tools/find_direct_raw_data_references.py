    """
    Finds direct references to raw data tables in the given list of BigQuery view builders.

    A direct reference is identified when a view queries the raw data we receive from a state, rather than querying the state-agnostic format.

    The returned dictionary has the following structure:
    {
        StateCode: {
            FileTag: Set[BigQueryAddress]
        }
    }

    - StateCode: Represents the state code of the source raw dataset.
    - FileTag: Represents the table id of the raw data table. Note that there is no distinction made for latest views.
               Ex, myFileTag_latest and myFileTag are both represented as myFileTag.
    - BigQueryAddress: Represents the address of the BigQuery view that references the raw data table.

    For example, a returned dictionary entry might look like this:
    {
        StateCode.US_MO: {
            'LBAKRDTA_TAK033': {BigQueryAddress(dataset_id='analyst_data', table_id='us_mo_restrictive_housing_record')}
        }
    }
    Note that the same view address may be included multiple times if it references multiple raw data tables.
