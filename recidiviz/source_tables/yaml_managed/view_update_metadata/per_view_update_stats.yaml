      `protopayload_auditlog.servicedata_v1_bigquery.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatistics.totalBilledBytes` for queries against tables with row-level permissions.

  # Generic complexity
  - name: graph_depth
    type: INTEGER
    mode: REQUIRED
    description: >-

    description: >-
      The number of distinct views that feed into this view. Counts *all* ancestor views, not just direct parents.

  - name: post_infra_library_composite_complexity_score_2025
    type: INTEGER
    mode: REQUIRED
    description: >-
      The query complexity score for this view added to all complexity scores for views that feed into this view, 
      defined using our 2025 definition of complexity. All views in the following datasets are assigned a composite 
      complexity score of 0: normalized_state, sentence_sessions. Select views in sessions and reference_views datasets
      are also designated "library" status if they provide a meaningful, state- and product-agnostic abstraction on top 
      of ingested data (see recidiviz/view_registry/infra_library.py). This field essentially tells us how much 
      complexity is added outside of the abstractions provided by core Doppler/DSI-managed libraries.
  - name: is_leaf_node

    mode: NULLABLE
    description: >-
      Boolean flag for whether this view is a "leaf node", or an view in our view graph that

  # State-specific logic
  - name: has_state_specific_logic
    type: BOOLEAN
    mode: REQUIRED
    description: >-
      True if this view contains state-specific logic (i.e. it references an explicit state code literal like “US_XX”

    description: >-
      The list of distinct state-specific raw data table (or latest view) addresses (in 'dataset_id.table_id' format) 
      that this view references in its query. This is a subset of the values in the `parent_addresses` column.
