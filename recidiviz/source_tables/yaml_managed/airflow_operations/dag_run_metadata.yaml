  - name: start_time
    type: DATETIME
    mode: REQUIRED
    description: |
      The time the DAG started, or the last time that a task was retried. n.b. If any 
      task or portion of the DAG was retried, this value will differ from execution_time.
  - name: end_time

    description: "The time that the last task in the DAG finished"
  - name: terminal_state
    type: STRING
    mode: NULLABLE
    description: |
      The last known state of the DAG. If the state is a failure, that does necessarily
      mean that the DAG failed to run, but rather that the last top-level task or 
      task grouped failed or had a failure in it.
