description: >-
  Produced by the U.S. Census Bureau, this data has postcensal estimates of the 
  July 1 resident population with six "single-race" race categories as specified 
  in the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards for the collection 
  of data on race and ethnicity: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, 
  Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, White, 
  More than one race.

  A single row has the number of people that are of the age group, race, ethnicity,
  and gender within that state. This data is transformed by us to fit into our
  StateRace enum.
