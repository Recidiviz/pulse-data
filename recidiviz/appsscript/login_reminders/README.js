/* 

Hello! Before you send any email reminders please go through this checklist to make sure everything is correct. 

1. Change any script wording, and MAKE SURE TO PRESS SAVE (button to the left of 'Run')
2. Ensure that you're emailing the right states! Here are the areas to double check:
   - (TODO(#35738): update with instructions about how to add/remove states to email,
     once we are set up to correctly handle state code filters within the queries in code)
   - The state-specific text at the top of EmailReminderHelpers.js and the text inside
   opportunityText and outliersText within that file.
3. If there are any districts that you do NOT want to email, add them to 
   EXCLUDED_DISTRICTS at the top of SendLinestaffEmailReminders.gs 
   or SendSupervisorEmailReminders.gs

If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out in the #email_reminder_rollouts
Slack channel.
