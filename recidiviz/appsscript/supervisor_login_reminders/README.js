/* 

Hello! Before you send any email reminders please go through this checklist to make sure everything is correct. 

1. Make any necessary wording changes, and MAKE SURE TO PRESS SAVE (button to the left of 'Run')
2. Ensure that you're emailing the right states! Here are the areas to double check:
   - The 'state_code' column in the connected sheets. Are any states missing? Add them!
   - The state-specific if statements. This is where you can change any state-specific text, add 
      states by adding an if statement, or get rid of states by deleting the if statement
3. Ensure that you have the correct 'Sent Emails' sheet set up by creating a new sheet
   in the connected sheet named "Month Year Sent Emails", e.g. "December 2024 Sent Emails"
4. If there are any districts that you do NOT want to email, add them to EXCLUDED_DISTRICTS

If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out in the #email_reminder_rollouts
Slack channel.
